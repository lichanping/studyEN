Is Your House Making You Fat?
你的房屋会让你长胖吗？

Your house may have an effect on your figure. Experts say the way you design your home could play a role in whether you pack on the pounds or keep them off. You can make your environment work for you instead of against you. Here are some ways to turn your home into part of diet plan. 

你的房子可能对你的身材有影响。专家说，你设计房屋的方式可能会影响你的体重是增加还是减少。你可以让你的环境为你工作，而不是与你作对。这里有一些方法可以把你的家变成饮食计划的一部分。

Open the curtains and turn up the lights. Dark environments are more likely to encourage overeating, for people are often less self-conscious（难为情）when they're in poorly lit places-and so more likely to eat lots of food. If your home doesn't have enough window light, get more lamps and flood the place with brightness. 

拉开窗帘，把灯调亮。黑暗的环境更容易鼓励暴饮暴食，因为当人们在光线不足的地方时，他们往往不那么难为情，所以更有可能吃很多食物。如果你的家没有足够的窗户光线，那就多装一些灯，让整个房间充满明亮。

Mind the colors. Research suggests warm colors fuel our appetites. In one study, people who ate meals in a blue room consumed 33 percent less than those in a yellow or red room. Warm colors like yellow make food appear more appetizing, while cold colors make us feel less hungry. So when it's time to repaint, go blue. 

注意颜色。研究表明，暖色能促进食欲。在一项研究中，在蓝色房间吃饭的人比在黄色或红色房间吃饭的人少吃33%。像黄色这样的暖色会让食物看起来更开胃，而冷色会让我们感觉不那么饿。所以要重新粉刷的时候，用蓝色。

Don't forget the clock—or the radio. People who eat slowly tend to consume about 70 fewer calories（卡路里）per meal than those who rush through their meals. Begin keeping track of the time, and try to make dinner last at least 30 minutes, and while you're eating it, actually sit down to eat. If you need some help slowing down, turn on relaxing music. It makes you less likely to rush through a meal. 

别忘了钟，也别忘了收音机。细嚼慢咽的人每餐摄入的热量要比匆匆吃饭的人少70卡路里。开始记录时间，尽量让晚餐持续至少30分钟，当你在吃的时候，坐下来吃。如果你需要一些帮助，放慢节奏，打开放松的音乐。这会让你不那么匆匆忙忙地吃完一顿饭。

Downsize the dishes, big serving bowls and plates can easily make us fat. We eat about 22 percent more when using a 12-inch plate instead of a 10-inch plate. When we choose a large spoon over a smaller one, total intake（摄入） jumps by 14 percent. And we'll pour about 30 percent more liquid into a short, wide glass than a tall, skinny glass. 

用小尺寸的盘子，大的碗和盘子很容易使我们发胖。我们用12英寸的盘子比用10英寸的盘子多吃22%。当我们选择大勺子而不是小勺子时，总摄入量会增加14%。相比于一个高而细的杯子，我们会把大约30%的额外液体倒进一个短而宽的杯子里。

你的房屋会让你长胖吗？
主旨大意：房屋会影响人的。比如灯光会影响人的食欲，在黑暗的环境下人更易暴饮暴食；暖色也可以促进食欲；比如狼吞虎咽，细嚼慢咽可以减少热量摄入；大的碗和盘子很容易使我们发胖。



长难句：
1. Dark environments are more likely to encourage overeating, for people are often less self-conscious when they're in poorly lit places-and so more likely to eat lots of food.
在这句话中，主句为Dark environments are more likely to encourage overeating。而 for引导了一个原因状语从句，从句主干为people are often less self-conscious and so more likely to eats...，中间的when作为插入语，引导了时间状语从句。

2. In one study, people who ate meals in a blue room consumed 33 percent less than those in a yellow or red room.

主句为people consumed 33 percent less than those...，who后引导了限制性定语从句，修饰先行词people。



语法点：
1. 限制性定语从句：
句子Experts say the way you design your home could play a role in...中，the way后接省略关系词的定语从句，way后的定语从句可用that/ in which/ 省略，在从句中表示方式。

2. 比较级：

句子...consumed 33 percent less than those in a yellow or red room.中，less than表示比……少，如果加上倍数或者百分比，需要提在less than之前，句中表示比……少33%。后文同理。
