如何使用?

You have to swipe your MetroCard through the reader and then wait for the display to say “GO”.Unfortunately, this isn't as easy as it sounds at times.As with many other Metro passes, it can be kind of tricky at first, but if you can't get it working, you are not alone.Just watch other people and do what they do.

你必须通过读卡器刷地铁卡，然后等待屏幕显示“GO”。不幸的是，有时候这并不像听起来那么容易。和许多其他地铁通行证一样，一开始可能有点棘手，但如果你不会用它，你并不是唯一一个。看别人怎么做就怎么做。
