The Evolution of Language
语言的演变

Languages have been coming and going for thousands of years, but in recent times there has been less coming and a lot more going.When the world was still populated by hunter-gatherers, small, tightly knit（联系） groups developed their own patterns of speech independent of each other.Some language experts believe that 10,000 years ago when the world had just five to ten million people, they spoke perhaps 12,000 languages between them.

语言来来去去已经有几千年了，但最近来的少了，去的多了。当世界上还居住着狩猎采集者的时候，小型的、紧密结合的群体发展出了各自独立的语言模式。一些语言专家认为，1万年前，当世界上只有500万到1000万人的时候，人们大概说着1.2万种语言。

Soon afterward, many of those people started settling down to become farmers, and their languages too became more settled and fewer in number.In recent centuries, trade, industrialization, the development of the nation-state, and the spread of universal compulsory education, especially globalisation and better communications in the past few decades, all have caused many languages to disappear, and dominant languages such as English, Spanish, and Chinese are increasingly taking over.

不久之后，这些人中的许多人开始定居下来成为农民，他们的语言也变得更加固定，数量也越来越少。近几个世纪以来，贸易、工业化、民族国家的发展和普及义务教育，特别是过去几十年全球化和更好的通信，所有这些都导致许多语言消失，而英语、西班牙语和汉语等主导语言正越来越多地取而代之。

At present, the world has about 6,800 languages.The distribution of these languages is hugely uneven.The general rule is that mild zones have relatively few languages.Often spoken by many people while hot, wet zones have lots, often spoken by small numbers.Europe has only around 200 Languages: the Americas about 1,000, Africa 2,400; and Asia and the Pacific perhaps 3,200, of which Papua New Guinea alone accounts for well over 800.The median number（中位数） of speakers is a mere 6，000, which means that half the world's languages are spoken by fewer people than that.

目前，世界上大约有6800种语言。这些语言的分布极不均衡。一般来说，温和地区的语言相对较少。经常有很多人说，而炎热潮湿的地区有很多人说，经常是少数人说。欧洲只有大约200种语言，美洲大约1000种，非洲2400种;亚洲和太平洋地区可能有3200个，其中巴布亚新几内亚就占了800多个。使用这种语言的人中位数仅为6000人，这意味着世界上一半的语言的使用者少于6000人。

Already well over 400 of the total 6,800 languages are close to extinction（消亡）, with only a few elderly speakers left.Pick, at random, Busuu in Cameroon （eight remaining speakers）, and Chiapaneco in Mexico（150）.Lipan Apache in the United States（two or three） or Wadjigu in Australia （one, with a question mark）: none of these seems to have much chance of survival.

在总共6800种语言中，已经有超过400种濒临灭绝，只剩下少数上了年纪的语言使用者。随机选择喀麦隆的布苏语(仅剩8人)和墨西哥的恰帕内奇语(150人)。美国的利潘阿帕奇(两三个)或澳大利亚的瓦迪古(一个，带问号):这些似乎都没有多大的生存机会。
