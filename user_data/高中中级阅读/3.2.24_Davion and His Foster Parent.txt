Davion and His Foster Parent
达维恩和他的养父母

In October 2013, Davion Only made an appeal on the Internet. He had learned that his biological mother had died not long before. ”My name is Davion and I've been in foster care （寄养照管） since I was born," he said, “but I'm not giving up hope. "

2013年10月，Davion只是在互联网上发出了呼吁。他得知他的生母不久前去世了。他说:“我的名字叫戴维恩，我从出生起就一直在寄养家庭，但我没有放弃希望。”

The heartbreaking appeal spread quickly, and Only's foster agency received calls from more than 10,000 people. Only ended up traveling to Ohio to live with a family. But after only got into a physical fight with one of his elder would-be brothers, the family changed their minds. 

这一令人心碎的呼吁迅速传播开来，Only的寄养机构接到了1万多人的电话。最后去了俄亥俄州和一个家庭住在一起。但在与他的一个准哥哥发生肢体冲突后，这家人改变了主意。

Back in Florida, Only passed through four different temporary homes over the following year, until he called Connie Going, his adoption case worker, to make a special request. Only had known Going for nearly ten years, and had asked every year if she would adopt him, but she always hesitated. “I always believed there was a better family than us out there," Going said in an interview. But last July, when Only called and asked again if she might adopt him, Going said something felt different. When he asked me, my heart felt this ache and I just knew he was my son, she said. 

回到佛罗里达后，Only在接下来的一年里辗转了四个不同的临时住所，直到他打电话给他的收养工作人员康妮·戈林(Connie Going)，提出了一个特殊要求。我认识戈已经快十年了，每年都问她是否愿意收养他，但她总是犹豫不决。“我一直相信世界上有比我们更好的家庭，”Going在一次采访中说。但去年7月，当Only再次打电话问她是否可以收养他时，go说感觉有些不同。她说:“当他问我的时候，我的心很痛，我只知道他是我的儿子。”

So Going, 52, invited Only to start spending time with the rest of her family-her two daughters, Sydney, 21, and Carly 17, and a son Taylor, 14, who she also adopted out of foster care. Eventually, after seeing how well the arrangement was working, Going, who had rented a bigger home, started adopting Only. Only moved in with her family last December. He officially joined Going's family on April 22, 2015, when the adoption papers went through. 

所以，52岁的Going邀请Only和她的其他家人——她的两个女儿，21岁的Sydney和17岁的Carly，以及她从寄养家庭收养的14岁的儿子Taylor一起共度时光。最终，在看到这种安排的效果之后，租了一套更大的房子的戈恩开始收养Only。去年12月才搬来和家人住。2015年4月22日，当收养文件通过时，他正式加入了go的家庭。

Today, I feel blessed and honored to have been chosen to be the parent of all my children, Going said. 

“今天，我感到很幸运，也很荣幸被选为我所有孩子的父母。”

主旨大意：达维恩在经历的几次失败的尝试后，最终找到了愿意收养他的家庭。



长难句：
1. He had learned that his biological mother had died not long before.
主句为he had learned that...其中that引导了宾语从句，作谓语动词learned的宾语。宾语从句的句子结构是主谓宾结构，时态为过去完成时。

2. But after Only got into a physical fight with one of his elder would-be brothers, the family changed their minds.

主句为the family changed their minds其中after后引导了时间状语从句，描述了发生在主句这件事情之前的事情。

3. Back in Florida, Only passed through four different temporary homes over the following year, until he called Connie Going, his adoption case worker, to make a special request.

主句为Only passed through four different temporary homes...其中back in Florida为地点状语从句。over the following year为介词短语作状语，表示“在接下来的一年”。Until引导了时间状语从句，表示”直到......”。时间状语从句中，句子结构为主谓宾结构，his adoption case worker为宾语Connie Going的同位语，解释说明她的身份。to make a special request为目的状语。
4. But last July, when Only called and asked again if she might adopt him, Going said something different.
主句为Going said something different,从句为when引导的时间状语从句。But last July是时间状语。从句中有两个由连接词and连接的谓语动词called和asked，if引导了宾语从句，在文中表示“是否”。

5. So Going, 52, invited Only to start spending time with the rest of her family-her two daughters, Sydney, 21, and Carly, 17, and a son Taylor, 14, who she also adopted out of foster care.

主句为Going invited Only...其中so为连接词，表示“因此，所以”。不定式短语to start...是宾语补足语，其中with引导了介词短语，表示“与...(谁)”。人名加年龄Sydney, 21；Carly, 17和Taylor, 14分别为two daughters和a son的同位语。关系代词who引导的限制性定语从句，修饰two daughters and a son。



语法点：
1. 过去完成时：had + done
文中He had learned that his biological mother had died not long before.有两个动词是过去完成时时态，第一个是had learned，第二个是had died。过去完成时的结构是had加动词的过去分词，表示对过去已经发生的事情对过去的某时刻的影响，是“过去的过去”。

2. 同位语从句

文中Connie Going, his adoption case worker中的 his adoption case worker是同位语从句，解释说明了Connie Going的身份。同位语从句一般用逗号隔开(也有不隔开的，如：the fact that…等），在句中放在名词后面，用于解释说明名词。同位语从句删除后，句子结构仍然完整。
3. everything, anything, something, nothing等的定语需要后置
文中 something different的形容词different本来应该放在名词前面，但是当形容词修饰复合不定代词这一类代词时，必须放在复合不定代词后面。
4. if引导的宾语从句
文中had asked every year if she would adopt him以及 asked again if she might adopt him都为if引导的宾语从句。这里的if不能翻译成“如果”，而应翻译成“是否”，转换成直接引语就是一般疑问句。
5. 宾语从句
文中I always believed there was a better family有省略了that的宾语从句，这里的宾语从句作believed的宾语。宾语从句在句子中作宾语成分，通常情况下，从句前的关系代词that可以省略。

6. 限制性定语从句

文中who she also adopted out of foster care是限制性定语从句，修饰先行词two daughters and a son，关系代词who可用于指代人物。该句中who在从句中作adopted的宾语。
