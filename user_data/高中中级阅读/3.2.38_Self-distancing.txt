"Self-distancing"
“自我抽离”

Your colleague's sharp comment keeps replaying in your mind. Two of your students are trapped in a "he said/she said" battle. When you reflect on your emotional reactions, you sometimes get caught up in cycles of negative feelings, which can make you feel even worse. If so, the answer may lie in a skill called "self-distancing", the ability to take a step back and view yourself more objectively. According to research, when people adopt self-distancing while discussing a difficult event, they make better sense of their reactions, experience less emotional suffering, and display fewer signs of stress. 

你的同事的尖锐评论不断在你的脑海中重演。你的两个学生陷入了“他说/她说”的争斗中。当你反思自己的情绪反应时，你有时会陷入消极情绪的循环中，这会让你感觉更糟。如果是这样，答案可能在于一种叫做“自我疏离”的技能，即退后一步，更客观地看待自己的能力。根据研究，当人们在讨论困难事件时采取自我疏离，他们会更好地理解自己的反应，经历更少的情感痛苦，并表现出更少的压力迹象。

But what might self-distancing look like in action?   Consider a typical "he said/she said" student conflict where they are each focusing on their own feelings. One is thinking, "I can't believe he did that to me. "And another insists, "She really hurt my feelings. "However, if you ask them to take the self-distancing, they might step outside of themselves and ask broader questions: "Why was he so hurt in this situation?" or "How did her anger affect him?"

但自我距离在实际中会是什么样子呢?考虑一个典型的“他说/她说”的学生冲突，他们每个人都专注于自己的感受。一个人在想，“我不敢相信他会那样对我。”还有人坚持说:“她真的伤害了我的感情。”然而，如果你要求他们采取自我距离，他们可能会跳出自己，问更广泛的问题:“为什么他在这种情况下如此受伤?”或“她的愤怒是如何影响他的?”

Although this approach may sound too simple to be effective, studies indicate that a change in point of view can have a powerful effect on the way people think, feel, and behave. Here are several different techniques you can try. 

虽然这种方法听起来过于简单而无效，但研究表明，观点的改变可以对人们的思维、感觉和行为方式产生强大的影响。这里有几种你可以尝试的方法。

First, consider how a thoughtful friend might respond after quietly observing their situation. Besides, avoid using the pronoun "I". Focus on using third-person pronouns, he, she, they, and they were able to see the stressful event as challenging rather than threatening. Finally, ask yourself, "How would I feel about this one week from now or ten years from now? "This form of mental time travel may be effective because our attention is directed away from our immediate, concrete circumstances.

首先，考虑一个体贴的朋友在安静地观察他们的情况后会如何回应。此外，避免使用代词“我”。注意使用第三人称代词，他，她，他们，他们能够将压力事件视为挑战而不是威胁。最后，问问你自己，“一周后或者十年后，我会有什么感觉? ”这种形式的精神时间旅行可能是有效的，因为我们的注意力从我们眼前的具体环境中转移出来。
