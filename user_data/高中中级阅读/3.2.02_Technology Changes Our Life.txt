Technology Changes Our Life
科技改变生活

It is impossible to tell what the future holds.For Nelly Cheboi, the future was guided by her childhood dream of wanting to change the lives of those around her; little did she know that technology would become the gateway for such change.

未来会发生什么是不可能的。对内莉·切博伊来说，她童年的梦想是改变周围人的生活，她的未来就在这个梦想的指引下;她当时并不知道，科技将成为这种变革的门户。

A native of Mogotio, Kenya, Nelly Cheboi grew up in a run-down house, walked to school barefoot every day, and went to bed hungry every night-something not uncommon for those in her community.Nevertheless, she studied hard and earned a full-ride college scholarship.She had consumed plenty of books growing up, but didn't know a thing about computers.If given a ten page paper in college, Cheboi would choose to hand-write it because she typed too slowly.

奈莉·切博伊是肯尼亚莫戈托人，在一个破旧的房子里长大，每天赤脚上学，每晚饿着肚子上床睡觉——这对她所在社区的人来说并不罕见。尽管如此，她努力学习并获得了大学全额奖学金。她从小到大读了很多书，但对电脑一窍不通。如果在大学里给她一篇十页的论文，Cheboi会选择手写，因为她打字太慢了。

It was only in Cheboi's third year of college that she encountered computer science—a subject she was fascinated by.She learned low technology could serve the economy and realized that, in order to fix the systems in Kenya that kept people in a cycle of poverty （贫穷）, she could encourage her community to work online.That then became the motivation for TechLit Africa.

直到大学三年级，Cheboi才接触到她所着迷的计算机科学。她了解到低技术水平可以为经济服务，并意识到，为了解决肯尼亚让人们陷入贫困这个闭环系统的问题，她可以鼓励她的社区在线工作。这后来成为了TechLit Africa的动力。

Founded in 2018, TechLit Africa is Cheboi's nonprofit organization that provides students in rural Kenya with access to technology and the ability to learn fundamental digital skills.Computers are donated, transported to Kenya, and then refurbished（翻新）locally.TechLit Africa provides the computers and curriculum to schools.Schools and parents cover for the costs of local operations.

TechLit Africa成立于2018年，是Cheboi的非营利组织，为肯尼亚农村地区的学生提供技术和学习基本数字技能的能力。计算机被捐赠，运到肯尼亚，然后在当地翻新。TechLit Africa为学校提供电脑和课程。学校和家长承担当地运营的费用。

Today, Cheboi is working on ensuring TechLit Africa keeps running, especially in terms of funding.She says that TechLit Africa's programs are the highlight of students' days-but it is difficult to convince parent , teachers and the county government of the digital economy and how technology can financially support people.

如今，Cheboi正致力于确保TechLit Africa的持续运营，尤其是在资金方面。她说，TechLit Africa的项目是学生们生活中的亮点，但很难说服家长、老师和县政府相信数字经济，以及技术如何在经济上支持人们。

“In a way, TechLit Africa serves as a bridge to connect two worlds-kids interact, ask questions and imagine what life is like out there while understanding the value of the Internet, ”Cheboi says.In doing so, kids unlock global opportunities and a second chance at a more fulfilling life.

Cheboi说:“在某种程度上，TechLit Africa是连接两个世界的桥梁——孩子们在了解互联网价值的同时，相互交流，提出问题，想象外面的生活是什么样子。”通过这样做，孩子们打开了全球机遇和更充实的生活的第二次机会。
