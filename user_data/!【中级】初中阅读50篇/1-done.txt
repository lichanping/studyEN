The community canteens  in neighborhoods in cities have attracted  more and more young people.
"It really helps and saves time，" said Yang Chen，who is 35 years old. "The price is low and the workers are nice，" Yang said while remembering his first experience  at Yunlin Canteen. "Buying a meat dish，a vegetarian dish  and a bowl of rice all together only cost me 13 yuan.That was quite cheap and the food was delicious."
Li Heng is another young eater at Yunlin Canteen. With a baby in his arms，Li said he and his family had been to the canteen for breakfast many times. "It's convenient  to have breakfast here because it's close to our home and the price is not high."
Many young people share their dining experiences at community canteens online. Under some posts，other users show their likes about the dishes and ask where the canteens are or if their neighborhoods have the same kind of canteens.
The community canteens are usually built to help old people in neighborhoods. "Young people have busy work and they have less time for cooking and cleaning the kitchen .And the takeaway food is not healthy and needs to be waited for a long time，" Zhou Jixia，a researcher said. The community canteens not only fill the young people's hungry stomachs，but also help them be free from cleaning the kitchen. So they are loved by more and more young people.
