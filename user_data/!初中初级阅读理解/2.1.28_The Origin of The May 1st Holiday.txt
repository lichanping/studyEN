The Origin of The May 1st Holiday
劳动节的由来

In many countries around the world, May 1st is a holiday which is called Labour Day or Workers’ Day. It is an interesting holiday that honours working people and their jobs. But do you know how it started?

在世界上许多国家，5月1日被称为劳动节或工人节。这是一个有趣的节日，纪念劳动人民和他们的工作。但你知道是怎么开始的吗?

During the late 1880s, in many parts of the world, people worked for fourteen to sixteen hours a day in factories but made very little money. Later, in the United States and Canada, working people got together to set up unions（工会）. The union leaders asked factory bosses for shorter working time and higher salaries（工资）, but many of the bosses refused their ideas. 

在19世纪80年代末，在世界上许多地方，人们在工厂里每天工作14到16个小时，但赚的钱却很少。后来，在美国和加拿大，劳动人民联合起来成立了工会。工会领导人要求工厂老板缩短工作时间和提高工资，但许多老板拒绝了他们的想法。

On May 1st, 1886, men and women in the United States and Canada stopped working and went onto the streets. They walked through cities and towns to force bosses to let them work eight hours a day. In the city of Chicago, several people died in fighting against the police. Over the next few years, people in cities around the world stopped working on May 1st to honour workers everywhere. By the early twentieth century, the first of May became a national holiday in many countries. 

1886年5月1日，美国和加拿大的男男女女停止工作，走上街头。他们穿过城镇，迫使老板允许他们每天工作八小时。在芝加哥市，有几人在与警察的战斗中丧生。在接下来的几年里，世界各地城市的人们在5月1日停止工作，以纪念各地的工人。到20世纪初，5月1日成为许多国家的国定假日。

However, in the United States and Canada, May 1st is not a holiday. North Americans celebrate Labour Day on the first Monday in September. Today in the United States, Labour Day is mostly about having fun. People enjoy a long weekend and often celebrate it by having picnics with friends or family. In many parts of the United States, Labour Day is also the last day of summer vacation, and students return to school the next day. 

然而，在美国和加拿大，5月1日不是假日。北美人在9月的第一个星期一庆祝劳动节。今天在美国，劳动节主要是关于娱乐的。人们享受一个漫长的周末，并经常与朋友或家人野餐来庆祝。在美国的许多地方，劳动节也是暑假的最后一天，学生们第二天返回学校。
