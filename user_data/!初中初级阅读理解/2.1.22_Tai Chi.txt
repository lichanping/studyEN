太极拳

If you walk through a park in the morning, you might see people doing these slow and graceful movements（优雅的动作）. Tai chi, an ancient martial art（武术）, is a common kind of exercise in China. 

如果你早上走过公园，你可能会看到人们在做这些缓慢而优雅的动作。太极拳，一种古老的武术，是中国一种常见的运动。

UNESCO recently added tai chi to its Intangible Cultural Heritage List（非物质文化遗产名录）. Many tai chi fans were happy to hear about this. 

联合国教科文组织最近将太极拳列入非物质文化遗产名录。许多太极迷听到这个消息都很高兴。

“This will make tai chi more popular around the world.  Hopefully more people will become healthier by practicing it,” said Chen Bin, a tai chi master（大师） from the village of Chenjiagou, Henan. This village is the birthplace of Chen-style tai chi. 

“这将使太极拳在世界各地更受欢迎。希望更多的人能通过练习太极拳变得更健康，”来自河南陈家沟村的太极拳大师陈斌说。这个村庄是陈式太极拳的发源地。

It's true that doing tai chi is good for our health. It can strengthen muscles（强壮肌肉）, help us walk and move more flexibly（灵活地）, and make our hearts stronger. 

的确，打太极对我们的健康有好处。它可以增强肌肉，帮助我们走路和运动更灵活，并使我们的心脏更强壮。

But tai chi is more than just a sport. “It carries traditional Chinese philosophy（哲学）, such as being in harmony（和谐） with nature and using softness to beat hardness, ” Chen said. 

但太极拳不仅仅是一项运动。陈说:“它承载了中国传统哲学，比如与自然和谐相处，以柔克刚。”

Over 100 million people in more than 150 countries practice tai chi today. It has become an icon（符号） of Chinese culture.
