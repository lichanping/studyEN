The Dental Growth Record
长牙记

Bonnie helps take care of her baby brother, Brady. He is only seven months old, but two little teeth start to grow through his bottom gums(牙龈). His gums hurt, so he cries sometimes. Bonnie gives Brady a cold washcloth to chew(咀嚼)on, which comforts Brady's gums and Bonnie's ears. Soon the two teeth will come out completely, and they won't hurt Brady's gums anymore. However, in a few months, more teeth will appear. 

邦妮帮忙照顾她的小弟弟布雷迪。他只有7个月大，但他的下牙龈开始长出两颗小牙齿。他牙床疼，所以有时会哭。邦妮给了布雷迪一块冷毛巾让他咀嚼，这可以安抚布雷迪的牙龈和邦妮的耳朵。很快，这两颗牙齿就会完全脱落，它们就不会再伤害布雷迪的牙龈了。然而，几个月后，更多的牙齿会出现。

Bonnie has another brother, Bertie, who is four. Like most kids of his own age, Bertie has 20 baby teeth in all. They will start to fall out when he is five or six, and his adult teeth will start to appear. Bertie has already begged (请求)Bonnie to tell him how much money the tooth fairy will bring for each baby tooth. 

邦妮还有一个弟弟，伯蒂，今年四岁。像大多数同龄的孩子一样，伯蒂总共有20颗乳牙。当他五六岁的时候，它们会开始脱落，他的恒牙会开始出现。伯蒂已经求邦妮告诉他牙仙子每颗乳牙能给他带来多少钱。

Bonnie is nine and knows all about the tooth fairy. She has lost eight of her own baby teeth and eight adult teeth have already grown in their places. By the time Bonnie is 12 or 13, she will have a total of 28 adult teeth. All her baby teeth will be gone. However, there will still be four more teeth called wisdom teeth(智齿) waiting to grow. Wisdom teeth start growing Under gums at age 10, but don't actually appear until around the age of 19 to 21. Most people have to have their wisdom teeth pulled because there is no room left in their mouths. Bonnie is glad she has a big mouth. 

邦妮九岁了，她知道关于牙仙子的一切。她掉了八颗乳牙，八颗恒牙已经长出来了。到邦妮十二三岁的时候，她总共会有28颗成年牙齿。她所有的乳牙都会掉光。然而，还有四颗被称为智齿的牙齿等待生长。智齿在10岁时开始在牙龈下生长，但实际上直到19到21岁左右才会出现。大多数人不得不拔掉智齿，因为他们的嘴里已经没有空间了。邦妮很庆幸：她的口腔空间大。
