"Dream Team" and Quan Hongchan
“梦之队”与全红婵

People call the Chinese diving(跳水) team a “dream team”. It is one of the best diving teams in the world since the 1990s. Fourteen-year-old Quan Hongchan is a member of the team. 

人们称中国跳水队为“梦之队”。它是自20世纪90年代以来世界上最好的跳水队之一。14岁的全红蝉是这支队伍的一员。

At the Olympic Games in Tokyo, Quan was the biggest dark horse. She won two gold medals(奖牌) in the women's 10-meter platform dive. It was a big surprise to the team and Quan herself. “I did not think of winning(赢得) the gold medal,” She said.  “I just tried to do a good job. ”

在东京奥运会上，全是最大的黑马。她在女子10米跳台比赛中获得两枚金牌。这对团队和权丽珍本人来说都是一个很大的惊喜。她说:“我没有想过要赢得金牌。“我只是想把工作做好。”

Quan was born in a poor family in Zhanjiang, Guangdong. In 2018, she joined the Guangdong diving team and spent three years there before joining the national team at the end of 2020. She remembered how it felt when she started to learn diving at the age of7. “It was so much fun,” she said. “I need to practice hard every day and try my best every day,” she said. But it takes more than just interest for a beginner to become a good player. 

权出生在广东湛江的一个贫困家庭。2018年，她加入了广东跳水队，并在那里度过了三年，直到2020年底加入国家队。她还记得自己7岁开始学习潜水时的感觉。“太有趣了，”她说。她说:“我需要每天刻苦训练，每天全力以赴。”但是对于一个初学者来说，要想成为一名优秀的玩家，兴趣是远远不够的。
