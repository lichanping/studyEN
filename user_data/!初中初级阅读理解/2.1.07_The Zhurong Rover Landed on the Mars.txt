The Zhurong Rover Landed on the Mars
“祝融”号火星车在火星上着陆

The Zhurong rover was transported on a long journey to Mars by the Tianwen-1 spacecraft which began orbiting the red planet in February. The rover touched down on the surface of the planet before midnight on May 15, 2021. 

“祝融”号火星车是由“天文一号”宇宙飞船运送到火星的，该飞船于今年2月开始绕火星运行。探测器于2021年5月15日午夜前在火星表面着陆。

It is an important event for China, as only the U.S.A.  had ever managed to land something on our neighboring planet before Zhurong. Some other countries have also tried before, but their rovers have either crashed or lost contact. After landing, Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulated the mission team on its “outstanding achievement. ”

这对中国来说是很重要的事情，因为在祝融号之前，只有美国在我们邻近的星球上着陆过探测器。其他一些国家之前也尝试过，但他们的探测车不是坠毁就是失联。着陆后，中国国家主席习近平祝贺任务小组取得了“杰出成就”。

Less than a week after its landing, Zhurong returned its first two pictures. One is a black-and-white photo taken through a fisheye lens showing a view of where it landed. The other is in color, showing a view of the rovers’ solar panels (太阳能电池板). 

着陆不到一周，“祝融”号就传回了头两张照片。其中一张是通过鱼眼镜头拍摄的黑白照片，展示了它降落的地方。另一张是彩色的，显示了火星车的太阳能电池板。

If things go as planned, Zhurong will spend about three months studying the local environment around it and looking for signs of water ice on the Martian surface. 

如果一切按计划进行，“祝融”号将花费大约三个月的时间研究周围的环境，并在火星表面寻找水冰的迹象。
