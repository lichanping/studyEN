A Wonderful Weekend
一个愉快的周末

Linda and John like sports. In summer they swim and in winter they ski. They want to ski in the mountains this weekend, but they don't know about the weather. It's 7: 30 now, and they're listening to the weather report on the radio. 

琳达和约翰喜欢运动。夏天他们游泳，冬天他们滑雪。这个周末他们想去山上滑雪，但他们不知道天气如何。现在是七点半，他们正在听收音机里的天气预报。

“Friday is going to be cold and cloudy, but it's not going to rain. The temperature is going to be 10℃ below zero. It's going to snow on Friday night and maybe on Saturday morning. Saturday afternoon and Sunday are going to be clear, cold and sunny. ”

“周五将是寒冷多云的天气，但不会下雨。温度将是零下10℃。周五晚上会下雪，可能周六早上也会下雪。周六下午和周日将是晴朗、寒冷和晴朗的天气。”

Now Linda and John are excited. The weather is going to be great for a ski trip. They are going to have a wonderful weekend in the mountains. 

现在琳达和约翰很兴奋。这天气将是滑雪旅行的好天气。他们将在山上度过一个愉快的周末。
