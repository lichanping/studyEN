“Quiet” Carriages On The Train
火车上的“安静”车厢

Many of you have probably had this experience: You get on a train and are ready to take a nap or read a book, only to find that the passenger in front of you is watching a TV show on his tablet without headphones. The child next to you won't stop crying. And the old lady behind you talks on her phone during the whole trip. 

很多人可能都有过这样的经历:你上了火车，正准备小睡一会儿或读一本书，却发现你前面的乘客正在用平板电脑看电视节目，而且没有戴耳机。你旁边的孩子哭个不停。你后面的老太太一路上都在打电话。

Wish the train could be less noisy?There might be a solution for you. The Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway, one of China's busiest high-speed rail lines, will have “quiet” carriages (车厢) starting from Dec 23, 2020. 

希望火车能安静一点?也许有个解决办法适合你。京沪高铁是中国最繁忙的高铁线路之一，自2020年12月23日起，京沪高铁将拥有“安静”车厢。

In quiet carriages, onboard videos will be muted (静音) and announcements will be made at a lower volume. Doors at the ends of the carriage will be kept closed to reduce noise from other carriages. Train attendants will be responsible for making sure that passengers remain quiet and follow the rules. 

在安静的车厢里，车上的视频会被调成静音，广播的音量也会降低。车厢两端的车门将一直关闭，以减少其他车厢的噪音。列车乘务员将负责确保乘客保持安静并遵守规则。

Passengers who are willing to obey the rules can choose the quiet carriages when booking their tickets, according to China's national railway operator. 

中国国家铁路运营商表示，愿意遵守规定的乘客在订票时可以选择安静的车厢。

Some people have pointed out that this kind of quiet environment should be offered in all carriages. They say that having quiet carriages might give people the impression that they don't need to be quiet in non-quiet carriages. 

有人指出，所有车厢都应该提供这种安静的环境。他们说，安静的车厢可能会给人们留下这样的印象:在不安静的车厢里，他们不需要安静。

While some internet users are in favor of the new service, it has also sparked discussion about just how quiet travelers should be in quiet carriages. Many people have raised questions such as “What if I snore (打呼噜)?” and “Can we talk to our travel companions if we need to?”

虽然一些网友对这项新服务表示支持，但也引发了关于安静车厢内乘客应该保持多安静的讨论。许多人提出了诸如“如果我打鼾怎么办?”以及“如果需要的话，我们能和旅伴说话聊天吗?”
