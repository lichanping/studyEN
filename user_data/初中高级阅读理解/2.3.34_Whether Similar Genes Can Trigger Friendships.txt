Whether Similar Genes Can Trigger Friendships
相似基因的人是否能够引发友谊

Friends are the family you choose Do you know why?A new study by Yale University and the University of California San Diego can give us some reasons. 

朋友就是你选择的家人，你知道为什么吗?耶鲁大学和加州大学圣地亚哥分校的一项新研究可以给我们一些原因。

Scientists studied the genes（基因） of almost 2, 000 people. Some of these people were friends, others were simply strangers. Scientists found that friends had more genes in common than strangers. Pairs of friends had similar genes as people do with a distant relative（远亲）. This is about the human genome（人类基因组）. Although l% may not sound like much to geneticists（遗传学）, it is an important number. 

科学家们研究了近2000人的基因。这些人中有些是朋友，有些只是陌生人。科学家发现，朋友比陌生人拥有更多的共同基因。朋友之间的基因与远亲之间的基因相似。这是关于人类基因组的。尽管对遗传学家来说，%听起来并不多，但却是一个重要的数字。

Most people don't even know who their distant relatives are, yet we are somehow able to choose people who are like our relatives as friends.  Nicholas Christakis, a social scientist at the university told Live Science. This might be because similar genes make people visit similar places, or similar genes mean people will have similar skills. 

大多数人甚至不知道他们的远房亲戚是谁，然而我们却能以某种方式选择像我们亲戚的人作为朋友。该大学的社会科学家尼古拉斯·克里斯塔基斯告诉《生活科学》杂志。这可能是因为相似的基因让人们去相似的地方，或者相似的基因意味着人们会有相似的技能。

The most common gene that friends have is the "olfactory" gene. It affects（影响）a person's sense of smell. Imagine that you and someone else both like the smell of trees. You may often visit a park. Therefore, you may likely meet that other person and become friends. 

朋友之间最常见的基因是嗅觉基因。它会影响一个人的嗅觉。想象一下，你和另一个人都喜欢树的味道。你可以经常去公园。因此，你可能会遇到另一个人并成为朋友。

As a result of the study, scientists set an interesting test called the "friendship source". The test can tell whether two people could be friends by studying their genes. 

作为研究的结果，科学家们设置了一个有趣的测试，叫做“友谊来源”。这项测试可以通过研究两个人的基因来判断他们是否可以成为朋友。

Do you want to know who will be your friends with the help of the test?

你想知道谁会在测试的帮助下成为你的朋友吗?
