Poetry and Me
诗歌与我

Life has a way of shaping us. Life can make you doubt or question your purpose. These are thoughts that I have had in my head for many years. Poetry prepares me for my purpose. My purpose is poetry. 

生活有一种塑造我们的方式。生活可以让你怀疑或质疑你的目标。这些想法在我的脑海里已经存在很多年了。诗歌使我为我的目标做好准备。我的目的是诗歌。

In my journey toward purpose, poetry is my safety net. I started writing at the age of 5. By 13, I had written quite a lot of poems. Poetry was my escape from bullying by my peers (同龄人) and teachers when studying in an American country school. They bullied me because of the way I looked. This bullying gave me low self-respect. Poetry was my way to be seen, be heard and be known. 

在我走向目标的旅程中，诗歌是我的安全网。我从5岁开始写作。13岁时，我已经写了不少诗。在美国乡村学校读书时，诗歌是我逃避同龄人和老师欺凌的一种方式。他们因为我的长相欺负我。这种欺凌让我失去了自尊。诗歌是我让别人看到、听到和了解我的方式。

For each important moment in my life, I write poetry. In hard times, I write poetry. I connect with poetry on a deep level. It helps me out of pain. However, writing poetry can't support me. So I turned to teaching instead. 

在我生命中的每一个重要时刻，我都写诗。在困难时期，我写诗。我对诗歌有很深的感情。它帮助我摆脱痛苦。然而，写诗不能支撑我。所以我转而去教书。

While living in China, my job is as an English teacher. I help teach two classes. The two Chinese teachers I work with tell me how to teach the students English. The teachers decide what I need to do in the classroom. In challenging situations like this, I keep on writing poetry. I write down my feelings. I draw pictures of the real world. I accept a new me. I learn to think about things with confidence. My relationship with poetry grows over time. Poetry stays in the depths of my soul (灵魂). 

在中国生活期间，我的工作是英语老师。我帮忙教两个班。和我一起工作的两位中国老师告诉我如何教学生英语。老师们决定我在教室里需要做什么。在这种充满挑战的情况下，我继续写诗。我写下我的感受。我画的是真实的世界。我接受一个新的我。我学会自信地思考问题。我与诗歌的关系随着时间的推移而加深。诗在我的灵魂深处。

There is nothing stopping you. The only person standing in your way is you. You have the power. Keep going. Keep believing. Remember that your hard work is not in vain. Go for it!Your purpose is waiting for you!

没有什么能阻止你。唯一阻碍你的人就是你自己。你有这个能力。继续。继续相信。记住，你的努力不会白费。去吧!你的目标在等着你!
