Reading and I
我与阅读

When I was younger, I was crazy about reading. I could get through a whole book in a day and used to beg my parents every night to let me stay up late so that I could just finish my chapter. 

当我年轻的时候，我非常喜欢阅读。我可以在一天内读完一整本书，每天晚上我都恳求我的父母让我熬夜，这样我就可以完成我的章节。

However, while there are many books for younger children, once you reach your mid-teens, the choices become limited. I found myself choosing between books for children that were simple and not that interesting, and adult books that I couldn't quite understand. 

然而，虽然有很多适合小孩子的书，但一旦你到了十几岁，选择就变得有限了。我发现自己在儿童读物和成人读物之间做出选择，前者简单而不那么有趣，后者我不能完全理解。

This lack (缺少) of choice finally led me to read less and less. When I was in secondary school, the only books I read were ones we were told in English class, and I was never very interested in my teacher's choices. 

选择的缺乏最终导致我的阅读越来越少。当我上中学的时候，我读的书都是英语课上讲的，我对老师的选择从来都不感兴趣。

Luckily, I realized quickly that deciding to go to university meant I had signed up for four years of reading books. I chose a French literature module (课程) in my first year. I started, thinking I wouldn't enjoy any of the work we were studying for the year. However, I soon realized that at a university level, the discussion was more fruitful and I found I had a lot to say!And being able to discuss my thoughts with others meant I could better understand the books. 

幸运的是，我很快意识到，决定上大学意味着我签下了四年读书的合同。大一的时候，我选择了法语文学模块。我开始了，想着我不会喜欢我们这一年学习的任何工作。然而，我很快意识到，在大学层面，讨论更富有成效，我发现我有很多话要说!能够与他人讨论我的想法意味着我可以更好地理解这些书。

I began reading again for pleasure, starting with Malcolm X's autobiography (自传) and never looking back. Now, during my year abroad, I spend a lot of my spare time in bookshops and reading in cafes. I'm so happy that I rediscovered my love of books. 

为了消遣，我又开始阅读，从马尔科姆·艾克斯的自传开始，再也没有回头。现在，我在国外的一年里，我花了很多业余时间在书店和咖啡馆里读书。我很高兴我重新发现了我对书的热爱。
