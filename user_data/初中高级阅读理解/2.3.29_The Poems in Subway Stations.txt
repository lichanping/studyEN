Writer Laurie Stroblas began the District Lines Poetry Project in 1994, hoping to give bus riders something better to look at than ads or graffiti. She had been leading poetry workshops in public schools, so she asked her students to lend a hand. 

作家Laurie Stroblas在1994年开始了“地区路线诗歌项目”，希望给公交乘客一些比广告或涂鸦更好看的东西。她曾在公立学校主持诗歌讲习班，所以她请求学生们伸出援助之手。

The response(反应) was unbelievable, says Stroblas. Later, she decided to transfer her ideas to the buses and picked new poems with the advice of 150 students. Organizations donated enough money to keep Metro Muse in subway stations all winter. In spring, a new crop of poems sprouted(萌芽) on city buses. 

人们的反应令人难以置信，斯特罗布拉斯说。后来，她决定把她的想法转移到公交车上，并在150名学生的建议下挑选了新的诗歌。一些组织捐赠了足够的钱，让Metro Muse在地铁站里摆放一整个冬天。春天，城市公交车上出现了一批新的诗歌。

What were the poems about?Snow falling, the arrival of a new year, love, fear, and peace. Cindy Rosales, a sixth grade student at Oyster Elementary School, was inspired(激励) by her favorite type of music: "Kindness is the jazz," she wrote.  "Bring the big jazz in.  The big whole jazz. "Like most poets, the kids had mixed feelings about letting the public read their private thoughts. I would feel glad that someone read my poem, one girl said.  "But I would feel sad if they missed their train. "

这些诗是关于什么的?雪花飘落，新年到来，爱，恐惧，和平。奥斯特小学六年级学生辛迪·罗萨莱斯的灵感来自于她最喜欢的一种音乐:“善良是爵士乐，”她写道。“把爵士乐带进来。整个爵士乐。”像大多数诗人一样，孩子们对让公众读到他们的私人想法感到复杂。一个女孩说:“如果有人读我的诗，我会很高兴。”“但如果他们错过了火车，我会感到难过。”
