Three-child Policy
三胎政策

China would allow all married couples to have as many as three children from May 31, 2021. The decision came five and a half years after the country allowed all couples to have two children. 

从2021年5月31日起，中国将允许所有已婚夫妇生育最多三个孩子。这一决定是在国家允许所有夫妇生育两个孩子五年半之后做出的。

The decision was made at a meeting of the Communist Party of China. The move quickly followed the release of China's seventh census (人口普查) findings, which showed that the country's population was growing at its slowest rate since the 1950s. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (国家统计局), the number of babies born in China fell by 2. 65 million to 12 million in 2020. 

这一决定是在中国共产党的一次会议上作出的。这一举措紧随中国第七次人口普查结果的发布，该结果显示，中国人口增长速度是自20世纪50年代以来最慢的。根据国家统计局的数据，到2020年，中国出生的婴儿数量下降了265万，降至1200万。

China is hoping that the policy (政策) change will help solve the problem of its falling birth rate and aging population. Xinhua News Agency said the change would help to improve the structure of the country's population. 

中国希望这一政策的改变将有助于解决出生率下降和人口老龄化的问题。新华社称，这一变化将有助于改善我国的人口结构。

The new policy will come with several supportive measures (支持措施). Among these measures, China will lower educational costs for families, step up tax (税) and housing support and make sure to protect the rights and interests (利益) of working women. It would also seek (寻求) to educate young people "on marriage and love". 

新政策将会出台几项支持性措施。在这些措施中，中国将降低家庭的教育成本，加大税收和住房支持力度，并确保保护职业妇女的权益。它还将寻求对年轻人进行“婚姻和爱情”教育。

As shown in China's 14th Five-Year Plan, China has come to a time when its aging problem must be taken seriously at the national level. It is hoped by the government that this change in birth policy will be part of the solution (解决方法). 

正如中国的“十四五”规划所示，中国已经到了必须在国家层面认真对待老龄化问题的时候。政府希望这一生育政策的改变将是解决方案的一部分。
