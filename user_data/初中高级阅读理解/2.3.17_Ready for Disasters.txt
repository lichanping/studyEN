Ready for Disasters
灾难前的准备

There are many different kinds of disasters around the world. As an adult you know what to do during a disaster, but what about the children?Some adults think it would probably never happen to them, so they don't teach their children what to do. Before it's too late, here are ways to help you prepare your child for a disaster：

世界上有许多不同种类的灾难。作为成年人，你知道在灾难中该做什么，但孩子们怎么办?一些成年人认为这种事情可能永远不会发生在他们身上，所以他们不教孩子该怎么做。趁还来得及，这里有一些方法可以帮助你的孩子做好应对灾难的准备:

Educate: It is always good to let your child know about possible disasters. This doesn't mean children have to live in fear. When teaching them about disasters, keep the conversation positive(积极的) by telling them there is a solution(解决办法) to the disaster. Keep the conversations short, allow for questions and answer honestly. 

教育:让你的孩子知道可能发生的灾难总是好的。这并不意味着孩子们必须生活在恐惧中。在教他们灾难的时候，通过告诉他们灾难有解决方案来保持积极的对话。保持对话简短，允许提问和诚实回答。

Prepare: Always be prepared. That is the best advice for children. For example, when preparing for bad weather, get the tools you need, like candles, radios, food, water and medicine. Teach your child what is needed in certain disasters so that they know what is available for them, if ever needed. 

做好准备:时刻做好准备，这是给孩子们最好的建议。例如，在为恶劣天气做准备时，带上你需要的工具，比如蜡烛、收音机、食物、水和药品。告诉你的孩子在某些灾难中需要什么，这样他们就知道在需要的时候，他们可以得到什么。

Plan: You should always have a plan for you and your child for any dangerous situation. Write out a simple list that they can read. The plan could start with “listen to an adult's advice and/or call 119”．

计划:你应该为你和你的孩子在任何危险的情况下都有一个计划。写一张他们能读懂的简单清单。该计划可以从“听取成年人的建议并/或拨打119”开始。

Practice: Once you have got the correct safety tools and worked out the right plan, practice every few months. Practicing what to do during a disaster with your child will help them if the time comes. 

练习:一旦你有了正确的安全工具，制定了正确的计划，每隔几个月练习一次。和你的孩子一起练习在灾难中该做什么，这将在时间到来时对他们有所帮助。

Disasters can't be avoided but they can be lessened(减轻) once you are prepared and ready for one. 

灾难无法避免，但可以减轻，只要你做好准备。
