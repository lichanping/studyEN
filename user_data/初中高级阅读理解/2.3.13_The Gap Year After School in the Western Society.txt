The Gap Year After School in the Western Society
西方社会的毕业后的间隔年

In Western society, especially in the English-speaking world, the chance for young people to see the other countries and experience life is considered important. Many young people, when they finish school at the age of 18, take a gap year (间隔年) before they go to university. 

在西方社会，特别是在说英语的国家，年轻人有机会看到其他国家和体验生活被认为是重要的。许多年轻人在18岁完成学业后，在上大学之前会有一个间隔年。

Parents often want their children to grow up a little and see what the real world is like when they finish school. Although they are worried about their safety, many think that the advantages of independence (独立) and experience are worth the worries. Children are encouraged to be brave, independent and to explore (探索) the world on their own or with friends. 

父母往往希望他们的孩子长大一点，当他们完成学业时，看看真实的世界是什么样子。尽管他们担心他们的安全，许多人认为独立的优势和经验是值得这个担心的。我们鼓励孩子们勇敢、独立，自己或与朋友一起探索世界。

Young people also want to experience freedom and see what life is like on the other side. This other side could be the other side of the world or just the other side of life. For example, if they have a rich life, they may want to see how people in poor areas live. 

年轻人也想体验自由，看看另一边的生活是什么样子。这个另一边可能是世界的另一边，也可能只是生命的另一边。例如，如果他们生活富裕，他们可能想看看贫困地区的人们是如何生活的。

A gap year after school is also an important chance for young people to spend time thinking about what they want to do with their lives. A little bit of growing up and experience will help them make their important career (职业) decisions, especially when they are unsure about what they want to study. 

对于年轻人来说，学业后的间隔年也是一个重要的机会，他们可以花时间思考自己想要做什么。一点点的成长和经验将帮助他们做出重要的职业决定，尤其是当他们不确定自己想学什么的时候。

Another reason for going straight after school is to get a break from studying before they start the next few years of university. So anywhere you travel in the world, you will meet young European people exploring the world. 

毕业后体验间隔年的另一个原因是在他们开始接下来几年的大学生活之前从学习中得到休息。所以无论你在世界上的任何地方旅行，你都会遇到探索世界的欧洲年轻人。

So much of the world has been travelled and explored. The young people are now looking for more worthy experiences. Some of them work as volunteers to do something for the country they are visiting. Many gap year volunteers are now spending a few months teaching English in Thailand, helping feed giant pandas in China or building a well (井) in a village in Africa. 

世界上很多地方都被游历和探索过。年轻人现在正在寻找更有价值的经历。他们中的一些人作为志愿者为他们正在访问的国家做一些事情。许多间隔年志愿者现在花几个月的时间在泰国教英语，在中国帮助喂养大熊猫，或者在非洲的一个村庄打井。

These young people's wish to explore the world is an expression of the values of the societies that they are part of. Both discovering the world and making a positive (积极的) difference in it are important parts of the Western mind. 

这些年轻人探索世界的愿望体现了他们所处社会的价值观。发现世界并在世界上做出积极的改变是西方思维的重要组成部分。
