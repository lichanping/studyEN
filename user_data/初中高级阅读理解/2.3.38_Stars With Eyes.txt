Stars With "Eyes"
有眼睛的星星

Scientists have calculated(计算) that almost 2,000 nearby stars—and hundreds of possible Earth-like planets around those stars—have had a clear view of Earth during human civilization(人类文明时期). 

科学家们计算出，在人类文明时期，近2000颗附近的恒星——以及这些恒星周围可能存在的数百颗类地行星——都曾清晰地看到过地球。

If any of those planets have life, someone out there could find that there's life back here based on oxygen in our atmosphere(大气), or by radio waves from human sources. 

如果这些行星上有生命，那么根据我们大气层中的氧气，或者人类发出的无线电波，就会有人发现地球上有生命。

One way humans look for planets is by watching them pass in front of the star they are orbiting(环绕), which dims(使变暗淡) the stars light slightly. Lisa Kaltenegger, director of the Carl Sagan Institute at Cornell University(康奈尔大学卡尔·萨根研究所), and Jacqueline Faherty of the American Museum of Natural History wisely turned that around, looking to see what star systems could watch Earth as it passes in front of the sun. 

人类寻找行星的一种方法是观察它们从它们所环绕的恒星前面经过，这会使恒星的光线略微变暗。康奈尔大学卡尔·萨根研究所的主任丽莎·柯廷安格和美国自然历史博物馆的杰奎琳·法赫蒂明智地改变了这一观点，他们想看看当地球从太阳前面经过时，哪些恒星系统可以观测到地球。

They looked at the 331,312 stars within 326 light-years of Earth—one light-year is 9. 5 trillion kilometers. The angle(角度) to see Earth pass in front of the sun is so small that only 1,715 of those stars could see our planet at some point in the last 5,000 years, including 313 that can no longer see us because we've moved out of view. 

他们观察了距离地球326光年内的331312颗恒星，一光年等于9. 5万亿公里。地球从太阳前面经过的角度非常小，在过去的5000年里，只有1715颗恒星能看到我们的星球，其中313颗因为我们已经离开了视野而看不到我们。

Another 319 stars will be able to see Earth in the next 5,000 years, including a few star systems where scientists have already found Earth-like planets. 

在未来5000年里，还有319颗恒星将能够看到地球，其中包括一些科学家已经发现类地行星的恒星系统。

The closest star on Kaltenegger's list is Wolf 359, which is 7. 9 light years away. It has been able to see us since the mid-1970s. 

在柯廷安的名单上，离我们最近的恒星是沃尔夫359，距离我们7. 9光年。从20世纪70年代中期开始，它就能看到我们了。
