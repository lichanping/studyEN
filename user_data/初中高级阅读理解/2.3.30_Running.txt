Running
跑步

Think back to a time in your life when you tried something new. 

回想一下你生命中尝试新事物的时光。

When I was a teenager I volunteered to pass out water at a local race. I was so excited to see all the different runners who passed by and quickly took a cup of water. Some ran past, some walked past, and a few wheeled past. 

当我十几岁的时候，我在当地的一个比赛中自愿分发水。我很兴奋地看到所有不同的跑步者经过，并迅速拿了一杯水。有些人跑过去，有些人走过去，还有一些人骑着车过去。

I saw so many types of people doing it. I thought maybe I could do it too!The next year I decided to run for the race, but I had little running practice. I just wanted to finish. 

我见过很多人都这么做。我想也许我也能做到!第二年，我决定参加比赛，但我几乎没有跑步练习。我只是想把话说完。

On the day of the race, it was terribly hot. After running for about 5 miles, I was thinking, "I must be crazy.  Why did I do this? What was I thinking?"And at one moment, I said to myself, "I am never doing this again!"

比赛那天，天气非常热。跑了大约5英里后，我在想:“我一定是疯了。我为什么要这么做?我当时在想什么呢?”有一刻，我对自己说:“我再也不这么做了!”

That first 10 km race was quite an experience. I jogged(慢跑), I walked, I jogged, and walked. At times, I didn't know if I could finish. 

第一场10公里的比赛是一次非常难忘的经历。我慢跑，我走，我慢跑，我走。有时，我不知道我是否能完成。

Near the end, a 70-year-old man ran past me, very fast, and I felt a little embarrassed(尴尬的) that I was more than 50 years younger than he and I couldn't even keep up with him. But then I realized something. He was running his race and I was running mine. How often in life do we compare(比较)ourselves to others when we really shouldn't?I decided that I would not give up on running races and that one day I would be one of those 70-year-old men who were still running. 

快结束的时候，一个70岁的老人从我身边跑过，跑得非常快，我觉得有点尴尬，因为我比他年轻50多岁，我甚至跟不上他。但后来我意识到一件事。他在跑他的比赛，我在跑我的比赛。在生活中，我们有多少次不应该拿自己和别人比较?我决定我不会放弃跑步比赛，有一天我要成为那些70岁还在跑步的人中的一员。

As I crossed the finishing line, I was proud of myself. I didn't regret(后悔) having such an experience. 

当我冲过终点线时，我为自己感到骄傲。我不后悔有这样的经历。
