Grand Canyon
大峡谷

When I arrived, it was early morning and it was raining. I looked to the east—the sky was becoming grey. I got out of the car, went through a gate, and walked along a dark path. There was nothing to see, but I knew it was there. 

当我到达时，是清晨，下着雨。我向东方望去——天空变得灰暗了。我下了车，穿过一扇门，沿着一条漆黑的小路走着。虽然什么也看不见，但我知道它就在那里。

After about a mile, a stranger appeared beside the path. Am I going the right way? I asked. He knew where I was going. Yes, he replied, "you'll get there in five minutes. "Finally, I came to some rocks and stopped. I looked carefully over them, but it was still too dark to see anything. 

大约走了一英里后，一个陌生人出现在路边。我走的路对吗?我问。他知道我要去哪里。“是的，”他回答说，“你五分钟就能到。”最后，我来到一些岩石前，停了下来。我仔细地看了看，但天还是太黑，什么也看不见。

Suddenly, the rain stopped and the clouds cleared. The sun rose behind me and shone on the rocks. Far below me, the ground fell away and down to a river. I was looking across one of the wonders of the natural world—the Grand Canyon. 

突然，雨停了，云散了。太阳从我身后升起，照在岩石上。在我脚下很远的地方，地面塌陷，变成了一条河。我正在眺望自然世界的奇迹之一——大峡谷。

I looked down to the Colorado River, a silver stream nearly one mile below me. If you put the two tallest buildings in the world on top of each other at the bottom of the canyon, they still would not reach the top. Then I looked across to the other side of the canyon. It was about fifteen miles away, maybe more. Finally, I looked to my left and my right, and on both sides, the canyon went far away for more than 200 miles. The Grand Canyon was not just big. It was huge!

我俯视着科罗拉多河，一条银色的小溪在我下面近一英里处流淌。如果你把世界上最高的两座建筑放在峡谷的底部，它们仍然达不到顶部。然后我看了看峡谷的另一边。大约有15英里远，也许更远。最后，我看了看我的左右，在两边，峡谷延伸了200多英里。大峡谷不仅仅是大。它是巨大的!

I remained by the canyon for about half an hour, and I asked myself, "Is the Grand Canyon the greatest wonder of the natural world?"I certainly know the answer. 

我在峡谷边呆了大约半个小时，我问自己:“大峡谷是自然界最伟大的奇迹吗?”我当然知道答案。
