Countryside or City?
乡村还是城市？

In China, many people are leaving the countryside to find jobs in the cities, because the countryside is much poorer than the city, and often there isn't much work there. Services such as hospital and transport （交通） are usually much better in the city than in the countryside. They hope that their lives will improve when they move to the city. 

在中国，许多人离开农村到城市找工作，因为农村比城市穷得多，而且那里通常没有多少工作。城市的医疗和交通等服务通常比农村好得多。他们希望搬到城市后生活会有所改善。

But in the big cities of Europe like London or Paris, people are moving out of the city. These rich families want to live a quieter life. They are tired of the noise and the dirt(尘土)of the city, and they are tired of the crowded streets, crowded trains and buses. They don't want to live in the cities any more. They want a house with a garden in the countryside, and breathe the fresh air there. 

但在欧洲的大城市，如伦敦或巴黎，人们正在搬离城市。这些富裕的家庭想过安静的生活。他们厌倦了城市的噪音和泥土，他们厌倦了拥挤的街道、拥挤的火车和公共汽车。他们不想再住在城市里了。他们想在乡下有一所带花园的房子，呼吸那里的新鲜空气。

So they move out of the cities. Some don't go very far, just a little way out of the city, to the towns near the cities, other people move to the real countryside with sheep, cows and green fields. There, they start new lives and try to make new friends. 

所以他们搬出了城市。有些人不会走很远，只是离开城市一小段路，到城市附近的城镇，其他人搬到真正的农村，有羊，有牛，有绿色的田野。在那里，他们开始新的生活，并尝试结交新朋友。

Not all those who move from the city to the countryside are happy. After two or three years, many people who have done this feel that it was a big mistake. They don't make so much money and there isn't much work to do. People in the countryside are very different and aren't always very friendly. 

不是所有的从城市搬到农村的人都是幸福的。两三年后，许多这样做的人觉得这是一个很大的错误。他们赚不了那么多钱，也没有太多工作要做。农村的人很不一样，并不总是很友好。

As a result, quite a lot of people who have moved to the countryside move back to the city. “It's wonderful to see crowds in the streets and cinema lights,” they say. 

因此，很多搬到农村的人又搬回了城市。“看到街上的人群和电影院的灯光真是太棒了，”他们说。
