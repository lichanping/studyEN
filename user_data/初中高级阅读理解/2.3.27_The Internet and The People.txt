The Internet and The People
网络和人

It was raining. I went into a cafe and asked for a coffee. While waiting for my drink, I realized there were other people in the place, but I sensed loneliness. I saw their bodies, but I couldn't feel their souls (灵魂) because their souls belonged to the Net. 

天在下雨。我走进一家咖啡馆，要了一杯咖啡。在等酒的时候，我意识到这里还有其他人，但我感到孤独。我看到了他们的身体，但我感觉不到他们的灵魂，因为他们的灵魂属于网络。

I stood up and walked between the tables. When I came to the biggest computer, I saw a thin, small man sitting in front of it. I am Steve, he finally answered after I asked him a couple of times what his name was. I can't talk with you.  I'm busy, he said. He was chatting online and, at the same time playing a computer game — a war game. I was surprised. 

我站起来，走在桌子之间。当我走到最大的电脑前时，我看到一个瘦小的男人坐在电脑前。我叫史蒂夫，在我问了他几次他叫什么名字之后，他终于回答了。我不能和你说话。我很忙，他说。他一边在网上聊天，一边玩电脑游戏——一款战争游戏。我很惊讶。

I didn't even realize that the coffee was bad, just as Steve didn't notice there was a person next to him. Why didn't Steve want to talk with me?I tried again to speak to that computer geek (痴迷者), but not a word came out of his mouth. I touched his shoulder, but no reaction. I was unhappy. I put my hand in front of the monitor and he shouted, "Leave me alone. "I took a few steps back, wondering if all those people were having a nice conversation with their machines, not with people, especially Steve. I wouldn't predict the future of human beings if they preferred sharing their lives with machines instead of with people. I was worried and deep in my thought. 

我甚至没有意识到咖啡是坏的，就像史蒂夫没有注意到他旁边有个人一样。为什么史蒂夫不想和我说话?我又试着和那个电脑怪才说话，但他一句话也没说出来。我摸了摸他的肩膀，但没有反应。我很不开心。我把手放在显示器前，他喊道:“放开我。”我后退了几步，想知道这些人是不是在和他们的机器愉快地交谈，而不是和人交谈，尤其是和史蒂夫。如果人类更愿意与机器而不是人类分享生活，我不会预测人类的未来。我很担心，陷入了沉思。
