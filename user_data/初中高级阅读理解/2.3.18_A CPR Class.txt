A CPR "Class"
一次心肺复苏“课堂”

Robert and his brother were playing football in their front yard. Suddenly a woman ran out of her house shouting to them to call an ambulance(救护车). Her 12 week old baby seemed to stop breathing. She was so scared that she couldn't find her cell phone, so she had decided to rush outside to ask for help.

罗伯特和他的兄弟正在前院踢足球。突然，一个女人从她的房子里跑出来，大喊着叫救护车。她12周大的孩子似乎停止了呼吸。她非常害怕，以至于找不到她的手机，所以她决定冲到外面寻求帮助。

As the woman was trying to do CPR(心肺复苏术) on her baby, young Robert came in and told her she was doing it all wrong. He asked her to use two fingers, push on the chest 5 to 10 times, tilt(倾斜) the baby's head, plug(堵住) the nose and then do a mouth to mouth resuscitation by breathing into the baby's mouth.

当这名妇女试图给她的孩子做心肺复苏术时，小罗伯特走了进来，告诉她她做错了。他让她用两根手指，按压胸部5-10次，倾斜宝宝的头，堵住鼻子，然后对着宝宝的嘴呼吸，做人工呼吸。

Luckily for the baby, the woman accepted Robert's advice. Just for a second, came a loud cry from the baby. Soon the doctors came and the baby was sent to hospital. 

幸运的是，这位妇女接受了罗伯特的建议。就在那一刹那，传来了婴儿的一声大哭声。不久医生来了，孩子被送到了医院。

The most amazing part of this story is that Robert has not attended a CPR class. Instead, he learned it all by carefully reading the posters(宣传画)on the walls of his school hall. And, while he is now being called as a hero and even interviewed on TV, he is just glad to have saved the baby's life！“Thanks to the posters on the walls, he could save the kid！” his teacher said to the reporter proudly. 

这个故事中最令人惊讶的部分是罗伯特没有上过心肺复苏术课。相反，他通过仔细阅读学校大厅墙上的海报来学习这一切。虽然他现在被称为英雄，甚至在电视上接受采访，但他只是很高兴救了孩子的命!“多亏了墙上的海报，他救了那个孩子!”他的老师自豪地对记者说。
