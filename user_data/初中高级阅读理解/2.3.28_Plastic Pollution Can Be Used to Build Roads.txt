Plastic Pollution Can Be Used to Build Roads
塑料垃圾能够用于修路

We all know there is a problem with plastic pollution. Five trillion plastic bags are used every year. One million plastic drinking bottles are bought every minute. What if we could use plastic waste to build roads?This is what Toby McCartney has already done. 

我们都知道塑料污染的问题。每年使用5万亿个塑料袋。每分钟售出一百万个塑料饮料瓶。如果我们能用塑料垃圾筑路会怎么样?这是托比·麦卡特尼已经做过的。

In 2019, McCartney's UK-based company, MacRebur, built the world's first plastic road in Elgin town, Scotland. The plastic waste was made into grains (颗粒) and then mixed with bitumen (沥青). The road looks just like any other road. But it has improved strength and is more stretchy (有弹性的) thanks to the plastic. 

2019年，麦卡特尼的英国公司MacRebur在苏格兰埃尔金镇建造了世界上第一条塑料公路。将塑料废料制成颗粒()，然后与沥青混合(沥)。这条路看起来和其他路没什么两样。但由于使用了塑料，它的强度得到了提高，而且更有弹性。

Our technology can not only help solve the problem of plastic waste but also produce roads that deal better with changes in the weather, reducing cracks (裂缝) and potholes (路面的坑洼), McCartney told the BBC．

麦卡特尼在接受BBC采访时表示:“我们的技术不仅可以帮助解决塑料垃圾问题，还可以让道路更好地应对天气变化，减少裂缝(缝)和坑洼(洼)。”

McCartney's idea came from a trip to India. I saw people in India would put plastic waste into potholes and burn it. "The plastic would melt (熔化) down and form a seal in the hole. " said McCartney. 

麦卡特尼的想法来自于一次印度之行。“我看到印度人把塑料垃圾扔进坑里烧掉。麦卡特尼说:“塑料会融化(熔)，并在洞中形成密封。”

I knew that there must be some similarities between plastic and bitumen, which both come from oil.  That's how I started to think about mixing them, he said. 

我知道塑料和沥青之间一定有一些相似之处，它们都来自石油。他说:“这就是我开始考虑把它们混在一起的原因。”

"We're just a small part of ending the plastic problems, but it's nice to be part of it," McCartney said.  "I just don't want my daughters to live in a world where there are more plastics in our oceans than fish. "

麦卡特尼说:“我们只是结束塑料问题的一小部分，但很高兴能成为其中的一部分。”“我只是不希望我的女儿们生活在一个海洋中的塑料比鱼还多的世界里。”
