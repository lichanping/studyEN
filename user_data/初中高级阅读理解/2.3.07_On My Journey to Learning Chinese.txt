On My Journey to Learning Chinese
在我学习中文的旅途中

I left my hometown in London last year and now I have enjoyed working in this small city in China. Learning a foreign language opens you up to the culture and history of a country. So in order to know more about China, I started to learn Chinese. 

我去年离开了伦敦的家乡，现在很喜欢在这个中国的小城市工作。学习一门外语可以让你了解一个国家的文化和历史。所以为了更多地了解中国，我开始学习中文。

But at times, I found myself in funny situations. When I greeted strangers in China, they began to talk a lot and very fast. They asked me questions about everything. But all I could do was to look at them with a blank face. I had no idea what they were talking about. Were they just kind, funny or impolite?Many people want to make friends with me. But I am a bit upset when I find out the reason why they need a foreign friend. They just want to practice their English. I don't need friends like these. I like friends to share my feelings and ideas with. 

但有时，我发现自己处于有趣的境地。当我在中国和陌生人打招呼时，他们开始说很多话，而且语速很快。他们什么都问我。但我所能做的就是面无表情地看着他们。我不知道他们在说什么。他们是善良、有趣还是不礼貌?很多人想和我交朋友。但是当我发现他们需要外国朋友的原因时，我有点不安。他们只是想练习英语。我不需要这样的朋友。我喜欢和朋友一起分享我的感受和想法。

However, the more Chinese I learn, the more similarities I find it has with English. In English, “thick-skinned” is used to describe a person who doesn't care about criticism (批评). I was surprised to find that houlianpi in Chinese means the same. And both languages share some common idioms (习语). For example, “look on with folded arms” means xiushoupangguan, and “burn the boats” is similar to pofuchenzhou. 

然而，我学的中文越多，我发现它和英语的相似之处就越多。在英语中，“厚脸皮”被用来形容一个不在乎批评的人。我惊讶地发现，“厚连皮”在中文里的意思是一样的。两种语言都有一些共同的习语。例如，“look on with folded arms”的意思是“袖手旁观”，“burn the boats”和“破釜沉舟”类似。

I'm still on my journey to learning Chinese. I believe that sometimes you will have the most fun on a journey. 

我还在学习中文的路上。我相信有时候你会在旅途中获得最大的乐趣。
