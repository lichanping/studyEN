Who Steals My Cookie
谁”偷吃“了我的饼干

A woman was waiting for her flight at an airport.Then she went to airport shops and bought a book and a bag of cookies.She took a seat next to a man and started to read.She gave her whole attention to the book but happened to see the man taking a cookie out of the bag.At first she felt surprised but said nothing.She went back to her book.But the man seemed to enjoy the cookies too much and took more cookies from the bag.

一位女士在机场候机。然后她去机场商店买了一本书和一袋饼干。她在一个男人旁边坐下，开始看书。她全神贯注地看那本书，却碰巧看到那个男人从包里拿出一块饼干。起初她感到惊讶，但什么也没说。她继续看书。但那人似乎太喜欢饼干了，又从袋子里拿了更多的饼干。

With the passing of time, she was getting more and more angry.With each cookie she took, he took one, too.When only one was left, the man nervously took that cookie and broke it in half.He offered the other half to her and smiled.The lady took it angrily from his hand and thought, “After eating a half bag of my cookies, you didn't show any thanks. What a nerve (放肆)!”

随着时间的流逝，她越来越生气。她每吃一块饼干，他也就吃一块。当只剩下一块饼干时，那人紧张地拿起那块饼干，掰成两半。他微笑着把另一半给了她。女士生气地从他手里接过饼干，心想:“你吃了我的半袋饼干，却一点也不表示感谢。胆子真大!”

She was so angry, but was relieved (感到宽慰的) when her flight was called.She picked up her things and headed to the gate, refusing to look back at the thief.She boarded the plane and sat in her seat, reaching her hand in her bag.She was surprised to find a bag full of cookies in it.“If mine are here,” she said to herself, “the others were his, and he tried to share!”

她很生气，但当她的航班被呼叫时，她松了一口气。她收拾起自己的东西，向大门走去，连看也不看小偷一眼。她登上飞机，坐在座位上，手伸进包里。她惊奇地发现里面有一袋饼干。“如果我的在这里，”她自言自语道，“其他的都是他的，他想分享!”

But it was too late to say sorry and she realized it was she who was the thief.

但是说对不起已经太迟了，她意识到她才是那个小偷。
