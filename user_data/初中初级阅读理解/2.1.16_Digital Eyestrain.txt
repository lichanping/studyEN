Digital Eyestrain
视疲劳

Our lives have become more digital in the modern world. We can study, find information and communicate with friends through computers and phones. However, spending a lot of time working, reading, texting and gaming through digital devices is bad for our eyes. 

在现代社会，我们的生活变得越来越数字化。我们可以通过电脑和电话学习，查找信息和与朋友交流。然而，花太多时间在电子设备上工作、阅读、发短信和玩游戏对我们的眼睛有害。

According to the American Optometric Association, 70 to 75 percent of computer workers have eye problems. 

根据美国验光协会的数据，70%到75%的电脑工作者都有眼部问题。

Digital eyestrain(视疲劳)is one of the most common problems. People with digital eyestrain may get headaches, dry and red eyes, eye pain, watering and other problems. 

数字眼疲劳(视疲劳)是最常见的问题之一。患有数字眼疲劳的人可能会出现头痛、眼睛干红、眼睛疼痛、流泪等问题。

These problems have started to increase among children. “Children get cellphones at younger ages and are using them very often during the day,” Sarah Hinkley, spokeswoman for the American Optometric Association, told USA Today. 

这些问题在儿童中已经开始增加。美国验光协会发言人莎拉·欣克利在接受《今日美国》采访时表示:“孩子们在很小的时候就有了手机，而且白天经常使用。”

The good news is that there are many things you can do to reduce digital eyestrain. 

好消息是，你可以做很多事情来减少数码眼疲劳。

When using a computer, first sit in your chair and reach out your arm. Your hand should rest comfortably on the screen, as if you're high-fiving the screen. Put some books under the computer until your eyes feel comfortable. 

当使用电脑时，首先坐在你的椅子上，伸出你的手臂。你的手应该舒服地放在屏幕上，就像你在和屏幕击掌一样。把一些书放在电脑下面，直到你的眼睛感到舒服为止。

When you are using a mobile phone, keep it at least 30cm from your eyes and just below eye level. Try not to use it under sunlight. 

使用手机时，请将手机放在距离眼睛至少30厘米、略低于眼睛水平线的地方。尽量不要在阳光下使用。

Remember to take a 20-20-20 break: every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and look at something 20 feet（about 6 meters）away. 

记住要休息20-20-20:每隔20分钟，休息20秒，看看20英尺(约6米)外的东西。
