A Lifelong Learner
一位终身学习者

Wang Dakang was born in 1935 in a town in Sichuan. He is famous for his encouraging life story in his hometown. He is a model of lifelong learning now. 

王大康1935年出生于四川的一个小镇。他在家乡以他鼓舞人心的生活故事而闻名。他现在是终身学习的典范。

In the 1980s, Wang became the first person in China to finish a round-the-country trip with only a bicycle. He cycled across most of China between 1981 and 1984. During the 1278 days, he traveled more than 60 000 kilometers and later wrote his experiences into a book. However, his manuscript(手稿)was not good enough to be published at first. 

在20世纪80年代，王成为中国第一个只用自行车完成全国旅行的人。1981年至1984年间，他骑自行车走遍了中国大部分地区。在这1278天里，他旅行了6万多公里，后来把他的经历写成了一本书。然而，他的手稿一开始不够好，无法发表。

To better write his book for publication, Wang, who was a middle school graduate, decided to continue his studies. At the age of 61,he went to Sichuan Normal College to learn journalism(新闻学)in 1996. 

为了更好地写书出版，中学毕业的王决定继续他的学业。1996年，61岁的他进入四川师范学院学习新闻专业。

In 2000,Wang continued his studies in the same college and studied travel literature. In 2008,he went to Leshan Normal University to learn music and graduated in 2012. Then his 560 000-word book on his trip was finally published in 2016. 

2000年，他继续在同一所大学学习旅行文学。2008年赴乐山师范学院学习音乐，2012年毕业。2016年，他关于这次旅行的56万字的书终于出版了。

At present, Wang gets up at 4:30 a. m. and exercises for half an hour every morning. His study starts at 6:00 a. m. Then he reads and takes notes from People's Daily, a leading newspaper in China. Other daily activities include practicing calligraphy(书法),learning English, riding his bicycle and playing musical instruments. 

目前，王每天早上4:30起床。每天早上锻炼半小时。他早上6点开始学习。然后他阅读并做笔记《人民日报》，这是中国的一份主要报纸。其他日常活动包括练习书法、学习英语、骑自行车和演奏乐器。

“Right now I just feel there's not enough time every day as there are so many things I want to do,” Wang said.  “I still want to continue learning and I will study until the very end. ”

“现在我只是觉得每天的时间不够用，因为我想做的事情太多了，”王说。“我还想继续学习，我会一直学习到最后一刻。”
