长难句：

1. Each time they visit, you get a lucky ticket.

Each time引导时间状语从句，表示每一次...的时候，相当于when。

2. The reason why the game is so popular may have something to do with how lonely people are these days.


此句前半部分为why引导的限制性定语从句，关系副词why在从句中做原因状语。后半部分是以介词with加how引导的宾语从句。



语法点：

1.现在完成进行时：表示一个过去开始但现在仍在进行的行动。

Millions of Chinese have been playing a mobile game called Travel Frog recently.这句话中have been playing表示已经玩手机游戏，并且这个动作会一直持续下去。

recently是现在完成时的一个标志。句中表达玩旅行青蛙的游戏会一直有人玩下去。

2. 非谓语动词：过去分词做后置定语

a mobile game called Travel Frog recently，called后是对game的一个补充说明，call与game构成逻辑上的被动关系，因此用过去分词called。

3. 定语从句：

句子You play as the “mother” of a frog who lives alone...中，frog后接who引导的限制性定语，关系词who/that充当从句中主语的成分。

4. 宾语从句：


Many players have said that the lonely frog is just like them.动词said后面接了一个that引导的一个宾语从句。



重点语言点：
