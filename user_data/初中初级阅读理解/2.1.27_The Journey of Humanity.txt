The Journey of Humanity
《人性之旅》

Sacha Jafri is a famous artist from England. He lives in Dubai. Because of the pandemic, he couldn't travel around, so he decided to create the world's largest painting. 

Sacha Jafri是一位来自英国的著名艺术家。他住在迪拜。由于疫情，他不能四处旅行，所以他决定创作世界上最大的画作。

Sacha used a huge ballroom(舞厅)in a hotel to create his painting. The hotel was closed because of the pandemic. It took him about seven months to create the painting. He often worked up to 20 hours a day. His back even hurt while he was painting. Creating the painting used over 1,000 paintbrushes and 1,664 gallons of paints. 

Sacha在一家酒店的一个巨大的舞厅里创作了这幅画。这家酒店因疫情而关闭了。他花了大约七个月的时间来创作这幅画。他经常一天工作20个小时。在他画画时，他的背甚至都会疼。创作这幅画使用了1000多支画笔和1664加仑的颜料。

Sacha named his painting The Journey of Humanity. He hoped that it would help bring the world together to overcome the pandemic during this difficult time. When he finished it last September, he set a Guinness World Record for the world's largest painting. The painting is over 1,579 square meters. Since Sacha's purpose was to raise money to help children, he separated the painting into 70 large parts. He hoped that he could raise $30 million by selling the parts. 

Sacha将这幅画命名为《人性之旅》。他希望，这将有助于在这一困难时期使世界团结起来，战胜这一流行病。当他去年9月完成这幅画时，他创造了世界上最大的画作的吉尼斯世界纪录。这幅画面积超过1579平方米。由于Sacha的目的是筹集资金帮助儿童，他把这幅画分成了70个大的部分。他希望能通过出售画作筹集到3000万美元。

What's more, through the activity called Journey of Humanity, he hoped to raise more money for charity to provide education, health care and other helpful services for the children across poor areas. He said,“ When I was a child, I had little to eat.  Now I am able to do something.  I have to do something. ”He hopes that people can build a world full of love after the pandemic. 

而且，通过这次名为“人性之旅”的活动，他希望为慈善事业筹集更多的资金，为贫困地区的孩子们提供教育、医疗和其他有益的服务。他说:“当我还是个孩子的时候，我没有什么可以吃的食物。现在我可以做点什么了。我必须做点什么。”他希望疫情过后，人们能够建设一个充满爱的世界。
