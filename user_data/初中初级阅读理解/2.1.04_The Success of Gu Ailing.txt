Who is the next Chinese sports star?It may be Gu Ailing. The 18-year-old girl just made free skiing history in the 2022 Winter Olympics. 

谁是下一个中国体育明星?可能是谷爱凌。这位18岁的女孩刚刚在2022年冬奥会上创造了自由滑雪的历史。

Gu became a Chinese when she was 15. She decided to play for China in the 2022 Winter Olympics in June, 2019. She got two gold medals and one silver medal for China at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games. 

谷在15岁时成为了中国人。2019年6月，她决定代表中国参加2022年冬奥会。在2022年北京冬奥会上，她为中国获得了两枚金牌和一枚银牌。

People say she is talented. But Gu says talent is “only 1 percent” of her wins, saying that her hard work is important. While going to school in San Francisco, Gu could only practice on weekdays. She spent eight hours going to the ski hill and coming back. She did her homework on the way and made full use of her time. 

人们说她很有才华。但谷导表示，天赋只是她获胜的“1%”，她的努力很重要。在旧金山上学期间，顾只能在工作日练习。她花了8个小时去滑雪山然后回来。她在路上做了作业，充分利用了她的时间。

Although the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics have been over for several months, she is still preparing for her next competition as a full-time athlete. “Of course I want to win medals and even golds. ” Gu said, “but it's more important to show your style (风格) and love for the sport. ”

虽然2022年北京冬奥会已经结束好几个月了，但作为一名全职运动员，她仍在为下一场比赛做准备。“我当然想赢得奖牌，甚至金牌。”顾说:“但更重要的是展示你的风格和对这项运动的热爱。”
