王女士是一名来自吉林的护士。在新冠肺炎疫情期间，她在武汉工作，帮助人们抗击COVID-19。

“I came here with worries, but I knew it was my job. Our work was hard, but we could always get power from patients’(病人的) warm words. We didn't feel tired,” Ms.Wang said.

“我带着担忧来到这里，但我知道这是我的工作。虽然工作很辛苦，但总能从患者的温暖话语中获得力量。我们不觉得累，”王女士说。

It was the last day for Ms.Wang to work there. Her last four patients got well. Before leaving the hospital, the patients wrote letters of thanks to Ms.Wang. One of them wrote:

这是王女士在那里工作的最后一天。她最后四个病人都康复了。出院前，病人们给王雪红写了感谢信。其中一人写道:

You saved us. We must say thanks to you. We will always remember you. Welcome to Hubei to take a trip one day. 

你救了我们。我们必须向你表示感谢。我们将永远记住你。欢迎来湖北旅游一日游。

Ms.Wang cried (哭) after reading the letter. She cried a lot after she came to Wuhan. When she came on the first day and saw a lot of patients, she cried. She felt sorry for them. This time, she cried again. When some patients lost their lives, she cried. But this time, she felt warm.

王女士看完信后哭了。她来到武汉后哭了很多次。当她第一天来的时候，看到很多病人，她哭了。她为他们感到难过。这一次，她又哭了。当一些病人失去生命时，她哭了。但这一次，她感到温暖。

Ms.Wang's patients went back home with love and care from her. And Ms.Wang went back home too, with love from her patients.

王女士的病人们带着她的关爱回家了。王女士也带着病人的爱回家了。

主旨大意：讲述了王护士作为医务人员去武汉与新冠肺炎作斗争，在快要离开时，患者写了一封信给她表示感谢，让她感受到了爱和温暖。



长难句：
1.Before leaving the hospital, the patients wrote letters of thanks to Ms. Wang.
主句为the patients wrote...Ms.Wang, 另外Before leaving the hospital为介词短语，在句中作状语。



语法点：
1.When引导的时间状语从句：

When当...时候，在句子中作状语部分，修饰主句。When she came on the first day and saw a lot of patients, she cried.该句中主句为she cried,而When后连接的句子则为时间状语从句。



重点语言点：
at the time of 在...期间
help sb do 帮助某人做
get well 好转
welcome to sp 欢迎来到某地
take a trip 旅游
feel sorry/sad for sb 为某人感到难过
go back home 回家
