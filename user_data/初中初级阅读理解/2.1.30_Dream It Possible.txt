Dream It Possible
梦想成真

As students, you may have many dreams. They can be very big like becoming Superman, or they can be small. You may just want to become one of the top students in your class. When you have a dream, do you ever try to make your dream come true?

作为学生，你可能有很多梦想。它们可以很大，像成为超人，也可以很小。你可能只是想成为班上的尖子生之一。当你有梦想的时候，你有没有试过让你的梦想成真?

Follow Your Heart by Australian writer Andrew Matthews tells us that making our dreams come true is life’s biggest 【challenge】. 

澳大利亚作家安德鲁·马修斯的《追随内心》告诉我们，实现梦想是人生最大的挑战。

“You may think you’re not very good at some school subjects, or that it is impossible（不可能）for you to become a star.  These ideas stop you from getting your dream,” the book says. 

“你可能认为自己在学校的某些科目不太好，或者认为自己不可能成为明星。这些想法会阻碍你实现梦想。”

In fact, everyone can make his dream come true. The first important thing you must do is to remember what your dream is. 

事实上，每个人都可以让他的梦想成真。你必须做的第一件重要的事情是记住你的梦想是什么。

Don’t let it leave your heart. Keep telling yourself what you want. Do this step by step and your dream will come true faster. A big dream is, in fact, many small dreams. 

不要让它离开你的心。不断告诉自己你想要什么。一步一步地做，你的梦想会更快实现。一个大梦想实际上是由许多小梦想组成的。

【Never give up（放弃）our dream】. There will be difficulties on the road. But the biggest problem comes from yourself. You need to decide what is the most important. Studying instead of （代替）watching TV will bring you better exam points. Saving five yuan instead of buying an ice cream means you can buy a new book. When you get closer to your dream, it may change a little. Then you will be able to learn more skills and find new interests. 

永远不要放弃我们的梦想。路上会有困难。但最大的问题来自你自己。你需要决定什么是最重要的。学习而不是看电视会给你带来更好的考试分数。省下五元钱而不是买冰淇淋意味着你可以买一本新书。当你接近你的梦想，它可能会改变一点。然后你就能学到更多的技能，找到新的兴趣。
