Love is Sacrificial Action
爱是一种牺牲行为

I took my 9-year-old daughter, and 5-year-old son, Robbie to the shopping center. As we got to the “Petting Zoo” in the shopping center, the kids jumped up and asked, “Daddy, can we go?”

我带着9岁的女儿和5岁的儿子罗比去购物中心。当我们到达购物中心的“宠物动物园”时，孩子们跳起来问:“爸爸，我们能去吗?”

Both my wife and I were out of work.  However, I said, “Sure”, giving them 5 yuan each. They went away, leaving only 10 yuan in my pocket (口袋). 

我和妻子都失业了。但我说“没问题”，给了他们每人5块钱。他们走了，我口袋里只剩下10元钱。

In the Petting Zoo, kids can pay and play with a hundred of little animals while their parents shop. 

在宠物动物园里，当父母购物时，孩子们可以花钱和一百只小动物一起玩。

A few minutes later, I saw Susan walking along behind me. I was surprised and asked why she didn't go to play with the little animals. 

几分钟后，我看见苏珊在我身后走着。我很惊讶，问她为什么不去和小动物们玩。

She said sadly, “Well, Daddy, a ticket for Petting Zoo costs 10 yuan. So I gave Robbie my 5 yuan. ”Then she said the most beautiful thing I had ever heard. She told me the family motto(座右铭): Love is SACRIFICIAL(牺牲的) Action. 

她悲伤地说:“嗯，爸爸，一张宠物动物园的票要10元。所以我给了罗比5元钱。然后她说了一句我听过的最动听的话。她告诉我她的家庭格言:爱是牺牲行动。

I knew Susan loves animals very much…

我知道苏珊非常喜欢动物……

I was moved(感动的).  We went back to the Petting Zoo. While Susan stood there and watched Robbie playing with the animals happily, I put my hand into my pocket and took out the money. Sure, I must do that!

我很感动我们回到了宠物动物园。苏珊站在那里，看着罗比和动物们快乐地玩耍，我把手伸进口袋，拿出钱来。当然，我必须这么做!
