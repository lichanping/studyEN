The Causes of the Extinction of Dinosaurs
恐龙灭绝的原因

Millions of years ago, dinosaurs (恐龙) controlled the earth. And there were different types of dinosaurs on the earth. Some of them were no bigger than chickens, but all of them had very small brains(大脑). Later on, there weren't any dinosaurs. What happened to them?

数百万年前，恐龙控制着地球。地球上有不同种类的恐龙。他们中的一些没有比鸡更大的，但他们都有非常小的大脑。后来，再也没有恐龙了。他们后来怎么样了?

In the days of dinosaurs, the whole earth was warm and wet. There were many green forests. But the earth changed slowly all the time. When parts of the earth became freezing and dry (干燥的), the forests there died. Then dinosaurs could not find enough food to eat. This must be one reason why dinosaurs died out. 

在恐龙时代，整个地球都是温暖潮湿的。有许多绿色的森林。但是地球一直在缓慢地变化。当地球的部分地区变得寒冷干燥时，那里的森林就死了。然后恐龙找不到足够的食物吃。这一定是恐龙灭绝的原因之一。

What's another reason?We can make a guess. New kinds of animals came to the earth. Some had big brains and were fast and strong. They could kill dinosaurs. Some ate dinosaur eggs, too. 

还有别的原因吗?我们可以猜一下。新的动物种类来到了地球。有的脑容量大，跑得又快又壮。他们可以杀死恐龙。有些人还吃恐龙蛋。

There may be other reasons that we do not know about. Each year, people will find some dinosaur footprints (脚印) and bones. Scientists are trying to tell us more about dinosaurs. 

可能还有其他我们不知道的原因。每年，人们都会发现一些恐龙脚印和骨头。科学家们正试图告诉我们更多关于恐龙的事情。

主旨大意：文章讲述了恐龙灭绝的一些可能的原因，森林食物匮乏、外来物种的到来等都可能是灭绝的原因。



长难句：

1.This must be one reason why dinosaurs died out.
找到主句this must be...，why引导的则是定语从句，在从句中充当原因状语。



语法点：

1.比较级：no bigger than和not bigger than的区别
No bigger than chickens表达没有比鸡更大的，即和鸡一样差不多大小，而not bigger than chickens表达没有鸡大，即鸡更大一些。



重点语言点：

millions of years 数百万年
later on 后来
no bigger than 没有比……更大
make a guess 猜一下
try to do sth 尝试做某事
