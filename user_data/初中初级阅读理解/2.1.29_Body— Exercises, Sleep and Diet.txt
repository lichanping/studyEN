Body: Exercises, Sleep and Diet
身体健康：锻炼、睡眠和饮食

Boys and girls, how is your body?Now let’s imagine that your body is like a big factory. It takes in “materials” and puts out “goods”. If you start with poor materials, it’s likely that your goods won’t be high-quality. But if you use better materials, your goods will come out much better. 

孩子们，你们的身体怎么样?现在让我们想象一下，你的身体就像一个大工厂。它吸收“材料”，输出“商品”。如果你从劣质材料开始，你的产品很可能不会是高质量的。但如果你使用更好的材料，你的产品就会好得多。

What does this mean in real life?It means getting the right amount of sleep, eating food that is good for you, and exercising more often. You might not think about this much as a young student, but please believe in me that it becomes much more important as you get older. 

这在现实生活中意味着什么?这意味着要有适量的睡眠，吃对你有好处的食物，还要经常锻炼。作为一个年轻的学生，你可能不会考虑这么多，但请相信我，随着年龄的增长，这一点会变得越来越重要。

It is very good to start building a better “factory” at a young age. Getting into the habit of living healthily can help you a lot in many ways. If you get enough sleep—not too little or not too much, you will be able to focus better on your studies. Eating healthy food helps your body grow strong and fight off sickness. And exercise can help you stay fit both physically and mentally. 

在年轻的时候开始建造一个更好的“工厂”是非常好的。养成健康生活的习惯可以在很多方面帮助你。如果你有足够的睡眠，不要太少也不要太多，你就能更好地集中精力学习。吃健康的食物可以帮助你的身体强壮，抵御疾病。锻炼可以帮助你保持身体和精神上的健康。

This sounds like a lot to do. So start small—try to go to bed at the same time each night and wake up at the same time as well. Find time to eat a single apple each day—people often say “an apple a day keeps the doctor away”. Try to exercise each day, even if it’s only for 10 minutes. Doing these little things will help you build a great “factory”. 

听起来有很多事要做。所以从小事做起——每晚在同一时间睡觉，在同一时间起床。每天找时间吃一个苹果——人们常说“一天一个苹果，医生远离我”。试着每天锻炼，即使只有10分钟。做这些小事将帮助你建立一个伟大的“工厂”。
