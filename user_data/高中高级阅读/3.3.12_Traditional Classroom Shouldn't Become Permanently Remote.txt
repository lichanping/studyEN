Traditional Classroom Shouldn't Become Permanently Remote
我们不能永远远程学习

In the coming era of budget cuts to education, distance learning could become a common thing. 

在即将到来的教育预算削减时代，远程学习可能会成为一件普遍的事情。

The appeal to those in charge of education budgets to trade teachers for technology is so strong that they tend to ignore the disadvantages of distance learning. School facilities are expensive to build and maintain, and teachers are expensive to employ. It's true that online classes do not require buildings and each class can host hundreds of people, which can result in greater savings, but moving away from a traditional classroom in which a living, breathing human being teaches and interacts with students daily would be a disaster. 

那些负责教育预算的人对用教师换技术的诉求是如此强烈，以至于他们往往忽视了远程教育的弊端。学校设施的建造和维护都很昂贵，教师的雇佣也很昂贵。诚然，在线课程不需要教学楼，而且每个班级可以容纳数百人，这可以节省更多的费用。但是如果离开传统的教学课堂，师生之间没有了面对面的教学和互动，那将会是一场灾难。

Physically attending school has hidden benefits: getting up every morning, interacting with peers, and building relationships with teachers are important skills to cultivate in young people. Moreover, schools are more than simple places of traditional learning. They are also places that provide meals, places where students receive mental help and other support. 

亲自去上学有潜在的好处:每天早上起床,与同龄人互动，与老师建立关系是培养年轻人的重要技能。此外，学校不仅仅是简单的传统学习场所。他们也是提供膳食的地方，学生接受心理帮助和其他支持的地方。

Those policy-makers are often fascinated by the latest technology in education and its potential to transform education overnight. But online education does not allow a teacher to keep a struggling student after class and offer help. Educational videos may deliver academic content, but they are unable to make eye contact or assess a student's level of engagement. Distance education will never match the personal teaching in a traditional classroom. In their first 18 years of life, American children spend only 9% of their time in school. Yet teachers are expected to prepare them to be responsible citizens, cultivate their social skills, encourage successful time management, and enhance their capacity to compete in a competitive job market. Given these expectations, schools should not become permanently “remote”. 

这些政策制定者往往对最新的教育技术及其一夜之间改变教育的潜力着迷。但在线教育不允许老师在课后留住一个学习困难的学生，并提供帮助。教育视频可以传递学术内容，但它们无法进行眼神交流或评估学生的参与程度。远程教育永远比不上传统课堂上的个人教学。在美国孩子生命的前18年里，他们只有9%的时间在学校度过。然而，教师被期望把他们培养成负责任的公民，培养他们的社交技能，鼓励他们成功地管理时间，并提高他们在竞争激烈的就业市场上竞争的能力。考虑到这些期望，学生不应该永远远程上学。

The power of the classroom is rooted in the qualities of the people gathered in the same place, at the same time, including their nature, empathy, devotion and so on. Technology, no matter how advanced, should simply be a tool of a good teacher. 

课堂的力量根植于聚集在同一地点、同一时间的人们的品质，包括他们的天性、共情、奉献等等。技术，无论多么先进，应该只是一个好老师的工具。
