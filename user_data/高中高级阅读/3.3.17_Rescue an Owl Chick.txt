Rescue an Owl Chick
援救一只小猫头鹰

I work with Volunteers for Wildlife, a rescue and education organization at Bailey Arboretum in Locust Valley. Trying to help injured, displaced or sick creatures can be heartbreaking; survival is never certain. However, when it works, it is simply beautiful. 

我和野生动物志愿者一起工作，这是一个位于蝗虫谷贝利植物园的救援和教育组织。试图帮助受伤、流离失所或生病的生物可能会令人心碎;生死未卜。然而，当它起作用时，它就是美丽的。

I got a rescue call from a woman in Mutton town. She had found a young owl (猫头鹰) on the ground. When I arrived, I saw a 2-to 3-week-old owl. It had already been placed in a carrier for safety. 

我接到了一个来自蒙顿镇的女人打来的救援电话。她在地上发现了一只小猫头鹰。当我到达时，我看到了一只两到三周大的猫头鹰。为了安全起见，它已经被放在了一个载体里。

I examined the chick (雏鸟) and it seemed fine. If I could locate the nest, I might have been able to put it back, but no luck. My next work was to construct a nest and anchor it in a tree. 

我检查了这只雏鸟，它看起来很好。如果我能找到鸟巢，我也许能把它放回去，但没那么好运。我接下来得建造一个巢，并把它固定在一棵树上。

The homeowner was very helpful. A wire basket was found. I put some pine branches into the basket to make this nest safe and comfortable. I placed the chick in the nest, and it quickly calmed down. 

房主非常乐于助人。她找到一个铁丝篮子。我在篮子里放了一些松枝，使这个窝既安全又舒适。我把雏鸟放在窝里，它很快就安静下来了。

Now all that was needed were the parents, but they were absent. I gave the homeowner a recording of the hunger screams of owl chicks. These advertise the presence of chicks to adults; they might also encourage our chick to start calling as well. I gave the owner as much information as possible and headed home to see what news the night might bring. 

现在就差猫头鹰父母了，但他们不在。我给了房主一段猫头鹰雏鸟饥饿尖叫的录音。这些声音向成年鸟表明雏鸟的存在;它们可能也会鼓励雏鸟开始鸣叫。我尽可能多地向店主提供信息，然后回家看看晚上会有什么消息。

A nervous night to be sure, but sometimes the spirits of nature smile on us all!The homeowner called to say that the parents had responded to the recordings. I drove over and saw the chick in the nest looking healthy and active. And it was accompanied in the nest by the greatest sight of all — LUNCH!The parents had done their duty and would probably continue to do so. 

一个紧张的夜晚是肯定的，但有时大自然的灵魂会对我们所有人微笑!房主打电话说，猫头鹰父母已经对录音做出了回应。我开车过去，看到窝里的雏鸟看起来既健康又活跃。在巢里，伴随着它的是最壮观的景象——午餐!猫头鹰父母已经尽了他们的哺育责任，而且很可能会继续这样做下去。
