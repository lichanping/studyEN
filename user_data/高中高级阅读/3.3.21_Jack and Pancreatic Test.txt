Jack and Pancreatic Test
杰克与胰腺测试

Jack Andraka was 15 when he came up with an idea for a new way to test for pancreatic（胰腺）cancer. When Andraka was 14, a family friend died of the disease, and this affected him deeply. This kind of cancer is particularly serious because there is no test you can have done to find it in the early stages. By the time standard tests determine you have the disease, it is often too late. Realizing that this was the case, Andraka decided to try to develop a test that might catch problems at the earliest stages. 

当杰克·安德拉卡(Jack Andraka) 15岁时，他想出了一种检测胰腺癌(胰癌症)的新方法。安德拉卡14岁时，家里的一位朋友死于这种疾病，这对他影响深远。这种癌症特别严重，因为你无法在早期阶段进行检测来发现它。当标准检查确定你患有这种疾病时，通常已经太晚了。意识到这种情况后，安德拉卡决定尝试开发一种可能在早期阶段发现问题的测试。

The road ahead looked difficult for Andraka. He was still a high school student, and he wanted to create something that no one else had done. But Andraka read endlessly about the disease, wrote a proposal for his idea, and sent it out to 200 cancer researchers. Only one professor, Dr.  Anirban Maitra responded positively. Dr.  Maitra agreed to work with Andraka on his idea, giving him guidance and access to a laboratory. 

安德拉卡面前的路看起来很艰难。当时他还是一名高中生，他想创造一些没人做过的东西。但安德拉卡无休止地阅读关于这种疾病的资料，为他的想法写了一份建议书，并把它发给了200名癌症研究人员。只有一位教授，Anirban Maitra博士做出了积极的回应。麦特拉博士同意与安德拉卡合作，为他提供指导，并允许他进入实验室。

The next big reward for Andraka's perseverance was winning the grand prize at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. This great award is given to young innovators who have developed a world-changing idea. Developing the test is likely to take many years, but Andraka hopes the test will eventually improve people's lives and maybe save them. 

安德拉卡坚持不懈的下一个重大奖励是在英特尔国际科学与工程博览会上获得大奖。这个伟大的奖项是颁发给那些提出了改变世界的想法的年轻创新者。开发这种测试可能需要很多年，但安德拉卡希望这种测试最终能改善人们的生活，甚至拯救他们。

Jack Andraka is not alone as a young innovator. After all, there were 1,499 other contestants for the Intel award, and all of them had ground-breaking ideas. For Andraka, having a family that loves science and encourages creative thinking gave him an advantage. But the key for Andraka is that reading, research, and discovery are just plain fun, and the chance to improve the world around him in the process makes it even better. 

作为一名年轻的创新者，杰克·安德拉卡并不孤单。毕竟，有1499名其他竞争者角逐英特尔奖，他们都有突破性的想法。对于安德拉卡来说，拥有一个热爱科学并鼓励创造性思维的家庭给了他一个优势。但对安德拉卡来说，关键是阅读、研究和发现只是单纯的乐趣，在这个过程中有机会改善他周围的世界，让它变得更好。
