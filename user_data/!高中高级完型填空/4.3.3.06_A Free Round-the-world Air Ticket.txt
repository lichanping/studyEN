A Free Round-the-world Air Ticket
一张免费的环球旅行机票

A Toronto man is offering a free round-the-world air to the right woman. But restrictions apply. You must be named Elizabeth Gallahgher and have a Candian passport. 

一名多伦多男子向合适的女人提供免费环球旅行服务。但也有限制。你的名字必须是伊丽莎白·加拉赫，持有加拿大护照。

Jordan Axani, 28, said he and his then girlfriend, Elizabeth Gallagher, booked heavily discounted round-the-world air tickets in May, but their relationship ended and he did not want her ticket to go to waste . The ticket had a strict no-transfer（不可转让）policy , but since passport information was not required when booking , any Canadian Elizabeth Gallagher can use it. 

28岁的乔丹阿克萨尼说，他和当时的女友伊丽莎白·加拉赫在5月份订了打折的环球机票，但他们的关系结束了，他不想浪费她的机票。这张机票有严格的禁止转机政策，但由于订票时不需要护照信息，任何加拿大人伊丽莎白·加拉赫都可以使用它。

“I just want to see the ticket go to good use and for someone to experience a lot of joy,” said Axani. He posted his offer on a social networking website, and received thousands of e-mails, including thirty from actual Elizabeth Gallagbers with the right passports. “More interesting , there are hundreds of Canadians who are interested in changing their name to Elizabeth Gallagher,” Axani said. “It was absolutely out of control , thousands of e-mails, people around the world sharing their stories of travel. ”

阿克萨尼说：“我只是想看到这张票得到很好的利用，让一些人体验到很多快乐。”他在一个社交网站上发布了他的报价，并收到了数千封电子邮件，其中30封来自拥有正确护照的真正的伊丽莎白·加拉赫。“更有趣的是，有数百名加拿大人有兴趣将自己的名字改为伊丽莎白·加拉赫，”阿克萨尼说。“这完全失控了，成千上万的电子邮件，世界各地的人们分享他们的旅行故事。”

Axani wrote in his post that he is not looking for anything in return and that the woman who uses the extra ticket can choose to either travel with him or take the ticket and travel on her own. 

阿克萨尼在他的帖子中写道，他不寻求任何回报，使用额外机票的女性可以选择和他一起旅行，也可以自己拿着票旅行。

The trip is scheduled to start on December 21 in New York City and continue on to Milan, Prague, Paris, Bangkok and New Delhi before ending in Toronto on January 8. He said the lucky woman will be announced on the website and the trip will be shared online. 

这次旅行计划于12月21日从纽约开始，然后前往米兰、布拉格、巴黎、曼谷和新德里，最后于1月8日在多伦多结束。他说，这位幸运的女士将在网站上公布，这次旅行将在网上分享。
