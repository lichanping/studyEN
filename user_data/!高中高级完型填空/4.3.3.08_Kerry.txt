One of the easiest things in the world is to become a fault-finder. However, life can be great when you are not busy finding fault with it. 

世界上最容易的事情之一就是成为一个找缺点的人。然而，当你不忙于吹毛求疵时，生活也会很美好。

Several years ago, I received a letter from seventeen-year-old Kerry, who described herself as a world-class fault-finder, almost always bothered by things. People were always doing things that annoyed her, and nothing was ever good enough. She was highly self-critical and also found fault with her friends. She became a really boring person. 

几年前，我收到一封来自17岁的克里的信，她说自己是一个世界级的挑毛病者，几乎总是被事情困扰。人们总是做一些让她恼火的事情，而且总是做得不够好。她非常自我批评，也对朋友吹毛求疵。她变成了一个非常无聊的人。

Unfortunately, it took a horrible accident to change her attitude. Her best friend was seriously hurt in a car crash. What made it almost impossible to deal with was that the day before the accident, Kerry had visited her friend and had spent the whole time criticizing her choice of boyfriends, the way she was living, the way she related to her mother, and various other things she felt she needed to express. It wasn't until her friend was badly hurt that Kerry became aware of her habit of finding fault. Very quickly, she learned to appreciate life rather than to judge everything so harshly. ​She was able to transfer her new wisdom to other parts of her life as well. 

不幸的是，一场可怕的事故改变了她的态度。她最好的朋友在车祸中受了重伤。让这件事几乎无法处理的是，事故发生的前一天，克里去拜访了她的朋友，并一直在批评她对男朋友的选择，她的生活方式，她与母亲的关系，以及她觉得自己需要表达的各种其他事情。直到她的朋友受了重伤，克里才意识到自己爱挑毛病的习惯。很快，她学会了欣赏生活，而不是如此苛刻地评判一切。她也能够将她的新智慧转移到她生活的其他部分。

Perhaps most of us aren't as extreme at fault-finding, but when we're honest, we can be sharply critical of the world. I'm not suggesting you ignore problems, or that you pretend things are better than they are, but simply that you learn to allow things to be as they are— at least most of the time, and especially when it's not a really big deal. 

也许我们大多数人都不太会吹毛求疵，但当我们诚实的时候，我们可以对这个世界提出尖锐的批评。我并不是建议你忽视问题，或者假装事情比它们更好，而只是建议你学会让事情顺其自然——至少大多数时候是这样，尤其是当它不是什么大事的时候。

Train yourself to "bite your tongue", and with a little practice, you'll get really good at letting things go. And when you do, you'll get back your enthusiasm and love for life. 

训练自己“咬紧牙关”，稍加练习，你就会很擅长放手了。当你这样做的时候，你会重拾对生活的热情和热爱。
