4.3.2.20_ASL-American Sign Language
美式手语

While high school does not generally encourage students to explore new aspects of life, college sets the stage for that exploration.I myself went through this searching process and found something that has changed my experience at college for the better: I discovered ASL-American Sign Language(美式手语).

虽然高中通常不鼓励学生探索生活的新方面，但大学为这种探索奠定了基础。我自己也经历了这个寻找的过程，并发现了一些让我的大学经历变得更好的东西:我发现了美国手语。

I never felt an urge to learn any sign language before.My entire family is hearing, and so are all my friends.The spoken language were enough in all my interactions(交往).Little did I know that I would discover my love for ASL.

我以前从未有过学习手语的冲动。我的家人都在听，我所有的朋友也是。在我所有的交流中，口头语言就足够了。我一点也不知道我会发现我对美国手语的热爱。

The story began during my first week at college.I watched as the ASL Club performed their translation of a song.Both the hand movements and the very idea of communicating without speaking attracted me.What I saw was completely unlike anything I had experienced in the past.This newness just left me wanting more.

故事发生在我上大学的第一个星期。我观看了美国手语俱乐部翻译的一首歌。手势和不用说话就能交流的想法都吸引了我。我所看到的与我过去所经历的完全不同。这种新鲜感让我想要更多。

After that, feeling the need to explore further, I decided to drop in on one of ASL club's meetings.I only learned how to sign the alphabet that day.Yet instead of being discouraged by my slow progress, I was excited.I then made it a point to attend those meetings and learn all I could.

在那之后，我觉得有必要进一步探索，于是我决定去参加一个美国手语俱乐部的会议。那天我只学会了如何用手语。然而，我并没有因为进步缓慢而气馁，反而感到兴奋。然后，我决定参加这些会议，尽我所能学习。

The following term, I registered for an ASL class.The professor was deaf and any talking was prohibited.I soon realized that the silence was not unpleasant.Instead, if there had been any talking, it would have caused us to learn less.Now, I appreciate the silence and the new way of communication it opens.

下个学期，我注册了一门美国手语课。教授是个聋子，不许说话。我很快意识到这种沉默并非令人不快。相反，如果有任何谈话，它会使我们学得更少。现在，我很欣赏这种沉默，以及它开启的一种新的交流方式。
