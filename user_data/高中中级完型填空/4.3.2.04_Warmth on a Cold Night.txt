Warmth on a Cold Night
寒冷夜晚中的温暖

I was ready to pay for my bananas at the grocery one night, when fear seized me. My wallet was gone. I could only have left it on the G9 bus, which was now speeding in the dark to some unknown station. 

一天晚上，我正准备去杂货店买香蕉，突然一阵恐惧攫住了我。我的钱包不见了。我只能把它留在G9公交车上，这辆车正在黑暗中驶向某个未知的车站。

The heart-stopping moment was quickly followed by mental math. How much time and money would it cost to replace the contents of that little wallet？The credit cards, the driver's license, the cash, all lost to the bus. 

心跳停止的时刻很快就被心算所跟随。换掉那个小钱包里的东西要花多少时间和金钱?信用卡，驾照，现金，都丢在巴士上了。

Two hours later, back at my house, I heard a knock on the door. My husband answered it while I was on the phone in the dining room. Does Jennifer live here？ I heard a lady say. In my husband's hand was my wallet, with not a penny abandoned. She left before I could even make it to the door to offer my thanks. 

两小时后，我回到家里，听到有人敲门。当我在餐厅打电话时，我丈夫接了电话。詹妮弗住在这里吗?我听到一位女士说。我丈夫手里拿着我的钱包，一分钱都没有留下。我还没走到门口表示感谢，她就走了。

After sharing the story online, I heard from someone, who identified the lady as Erin Smith. Without delay, I called to thank her. She said she spotted my wallet on a bus seat. She calculated that going to a stranger's house was a risky move, but she decided to take the chance. If I were in that situation, I would want someone to try to find me, she said. 

我在网上分享了这个故事后，有人告诉我，这位女士就是艾琳·史密斯。我立即打电话向她道谢。她说她在公车座位上看到了我的钱包。她知道去一个陌生人的家是一个冒险的举动，但她决定冒这个险。她说:“如果我在那种情况下，我希望有人来找我。”

This one stranger responded beautifully to my small crisis, but she actually wasn't the only one. Right after Erin took possession of my wallet on the bus, she posted a picture of my driver's license to an online forum（论坛）, trying to see if anyone knew me. No sooner did she leave my doorstep than I had emails from two women whose kids go to my son's nursery and who recognized my face. I've never exchanged words with those moms beyond small tall, but they wanted to help. I read that people are more divided than ever, but that's not how the people I encounter tend to act. 

这个陌生人对我的小危机反应很好，但她并不是唯一一个。就在艾琳在公交车上拿走我的钱包之后，她把我驾照的照片发到了一个在线论坛上，想看看有没有人认识我。她刚离开我家，我就收到了两个女人的电子邮件，她们的孩子去了我儿子的托儿所，她们认出了我的脸。除了小个子，我从来没有和那些妈妈说过一句话，但她们想帮忙。我读到人们比以往任何时候都更加分裂，但我遇到的人往往不是这样做的。

Looking back, I feel blessed someone had wanted to help a stranger. Erin had gone beyond what almost anyone would have done, finding my house on a bitterly cold night, and for that I was extremely grateful. 

回想起来，有人愿意帮助一个陌生人，我感到很幸运。艾琳做了几乎任何人都不会做的事，在一个寒冷的夜晚找到了我的家，为此我非常感激。

主旨大意：作者遗失钱包后，本以为再也找不回来，但是一位热心的女士发现了钱包并还给了作者。通过这件事，作者感受到人间还有真情存在。

长难句
1. I could only have left it on the G9 bus, which was now speeding in the dark to some unknown station.
主句为I could only have left it on the G9 bus，其中情态动词could+have done表推测，从句是which引导的非限制性定语从句which was now speeding in the dark to some unknown station。
2. How much time and money would it cost to replace the contents of that little wallet？
该句疑问句，所以句子部分倒装。陈述句语序为it would cost how much time and money to replace the contents of that little wallet其中it为形式主语，真正的主语为不定式to replace the contents of that little wallet。
3. My husband answered it while I was on the phone in the dining room.
主句为My husband answered it其中while引导了时间状语从句while I was on the phone in the dining room，表示“当......的时候”。
4.In my husband's hand was my wallet, with not a penny missing.
主句为倒装句In my husband's hand was my wallet其中with引导的介词短语作伴随状语。伴随状语中missing
为现在分词作伴随状语，修饰a penny。
5. After sharing the story online, I heard from someone, who identified the lady as Erin Smith.
主句为I heard from someone其中who引导了非限制性定语从句who identified the lady as Erin Smith，修饰someone。After sharing the story online为时间状语从句。share的逻辑主语为主句中的I。
6.She calculated that going to a stranger's house was a risky move, but she decided to take the chance.
主句为She calculated that...but she decided to take the chance.其中that引导了宾语从句that going to a stranger's house was a risky move。连接词but表达转折，but she decided to take the chance中的不定式to take the chance作decided的宾语。
7.Right after Erin took possession of my wallet on the bus, she posted a picture of my driver's license to an online forum, trying to see if anyone knew me.
主句为she posted a picture of my driver's license to an online forum其中Right after Erin took possession of my wallet on the bus为after引导的时间状语从句；而trying to see if anyone knew me为try的现在分词trying引导的目的状语从句。目的状语从句中if引导了宾语从句，作see的宾语。
8. I read that people are more divided than ever, but that's not how the people I encounter tend to act.
该句为but连接的两个复合句，主句为I read that...but that's not how...其中第一个that引导了宾语从句that people are more divided than ever而how引导了表语从句how the people I encounter tend to act，作第二个复合句的表语。表语从句中I encounter为省略了that 的定语从句，修饰the people。
9.No sooner did she leave my doorstep than I had emails from two women whose kids go to my son's nursery and who recognized my face.
该句为no sooner... than...固定结构。该结构中，主句No sooner...使用一般过去时，并且是否定词置于句首主句倒装，而从句than...使用过去完成时。译为“一......就......”
10. Erin had gone beyond what almost anyone would have done, finding my house on a bitterly cold night, and for that I was extremely grateful.
主句为Erin had gone beyond...and for that I was extremely grateful.其中what引导了宾语从句，作介词beyond的宾语。finding my house on a bitterly cold night为现在分词finding引导的状语从句。

语法点：
1. 倒装句
文中In my husband's hand was my wallet为倒装句，当介词短语移到句首时，必须倒装句子，倒装句将强调的部分移至句首。

2. 非谓语动词：动名词
文中After sharing the story online有动名词sharing。动名词为名词化的动词。可以充当主语、表语、动词宾语、介词宾语和定语。该句中充当的是表语。同理，going to a stranger's house was a risky move中的going to...也是动名词短语。
3. 虚拟语气
文中If I were in that situation I would want someone to try to find me应用了虚拟语气。对现在情况的虚拟语气的结构为：从句为if+过去时；主句为should / would /could / might+do。如果从句是主系表结构而且主语为第一人称，be动词用were。虚拟语气是指说话人表示一种假设的情况，一种愿望，怀疑，推测，请求等，即认为动词所表示的动作或状态并非事实。虚拟语气可用于状语从句，名词性从句，定语从句及其他结构中。
4.非限制性定语从句：who引导
文中who identified the lady as Erin Smith为关系代词who引导的非限制性定语从句。它修饰前面主句中的someone，也叫先行词。非限制性定语从句的先行词和关系代词一般用逗号隔开，非限制性定语从句删除后，句子的结构不变。
5. 非谓语动词：现在分词作目的状语
文中trying to see if anyone knew me为try的现在分词作目的状语，表示“为了”。
6. 宾语从句：if引导
文中if anyone knew me为if引导的宾语从句。If表示“是否”。宾语从句在句中作宾语，也可以由that引导。如果是关系代词that引导的宾语从句，that可以省略。
7. 表语从句
文中that's not how the people I encounter tend to act.有关系副词how引导的表语从句，作is的表语。关系副词译为“如何”。
8. 限制性定语从句
文中...two women whose kids go to my son's nursery and who recognized my face.有由whose和who分别引导的定语从句，其中关系代词whose相当于形容词性物主代词。两个定语从句的先行词都为women。定语从句中如果先行词为人，关系代词只能用who或whose不能用that。
