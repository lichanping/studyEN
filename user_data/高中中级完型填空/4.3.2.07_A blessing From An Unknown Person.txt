A blessing From An Unknown Person
一份来自陌生人的祝福

When most of us get a text message on our cell phone from an unknown person, we usually say "sorry, wrong number!" and move on. But when Dennis Williams received a text that clearly wasn't intended for him, he did something special.  

当我们中的大多数人收到来自陌生人的短信时，我们通常会说“对不起，打错了!”然后继续前进。但当丹尼斯·威廉姆斯收到一条明显不是发给他的短信时，他做了一件特别的事。

On March 19, Dennis got a group text informing him that a couple he didn't know were at the hospital, waiting for the arrival of a baby. 

3月19日，丹尼斯收到了一条群发短信，告诉他一对他不认识的夫妇在医院里等着孩子的到来。

Congratulations! But I think someone was mistaken,Dennis responded.  The baby was born and updated texts were coming in quickly from the overjoyed grandmother, Teresa. In her excitement, she didn't seem to realize that she was sharing the baby's photos with a complete stranger. "Well, I don't know you all but I will get there to take pictures with the baby," replied Dennis before asking which room the new parents were in. 

恭喜你！但我觉得有人搞错了，丹尼斯回答。孩子出生了，喜出望外的祖母特蕾莎很快就发来了最新的短信。在兴奋中，她似乎没有意识到她正在和一个完全陌生的人分享孩子的照片。“嗯，我不认识你们所有人，但我会去那里和孩子合影的，”丹尼斯回答说，然后问这对新父母住在哪个房间。

Much to the family's surprise, Dennis stuck to his promise! He turned up at the hospital bearing gifts for the new mother Lindsey and her baby boy. Lindsey's husband was totally astonished by the unexpected visit. "I don't think we would have randomly invited him over, but we appreciated it and the gifts. 

令全家人惊讶的是，丹尼斯信守了他的诺言! 他出现在医院，给新妈妈林赛和她的宝贝儿子带了礼物。琳赛的丈夫对这次突如其来的拜访感到十分惊讶。“我不认为我们会随意邀请他过来，但我们很感激他的邀请和礼物。

Teresa posted a photo of the chance meeting on a social networking website accompanied by the touching words: "What a blessing this young man was to our family! He was so sweet and kind to do this. "The post has since gained the attention of social media users all over the world, receiving more than 184,000 shares and 61,500 likes in just three days. 

特蕾莎修女在社交网站上晒出了这次偶然相遇的照片，并附上了感人的文字：“这个年轻人对我们家来说是多么的幸运啊!他这么做真是太贴心了。”这条微博引起了全球社交媒体用户的关注，在短短三天内就获得了超过18. 4万次分享和6. 15万次点赞。
