一堂围棋课

I jumped at the idea of taking the class because, after all, who doesn’t want to save a few dollars?More than that, I’d always wanted to learn chess.And,even if I weren’t excited enough about free credits, news about our instructor was appealing enough to me.He was an international grandmaster, which meant I would be learning from one of the game’s best. I could hardly wait to meet him.During my second year at the city college, I was told that the education department was offering a “free” course, called Thinking Chess, for three credits.

我欣然接受了上这门课的想法，因为，毕竟，谁不想省下几块钱呢?更重要的是，我一直想学国际象棋。而且，即使我对免费学分不够兴奋，关于我们教练的消息对我来说也足够有吸引力。他是一名国际特级大师，这意味着我将向最优秀的棋手之一学习。我迫不及待地想见到他。在城市学院的第二年，有人告诉我，教育部门开设了一门“免费”课程，名为“思考象棋”，有三个学分。

Maurice Ashley was kind and smart, a former graduate returning to teach, and this job was no game for him;  He meant business.In his introduction, he made it clear that our credits would be hard-earned.In order to pass the class, among other criteria, we had to write a paper on how we plan to apply what we would learn in class to our future professions and, eventually, to our lives.I managed to get an A in that course and learned life lessons that have served me well beyond the classroom.

莫里斯·阿什利善良、聪明，是一名毕业后回来教书的教师，这份工作对他来说不是游戏;他是认真的。在他的介绍中，他明确表示，我们的学分是来之不易的。为了通过这门课，除了其他标准外，我们还必须写一篇论文，说明我们计划如何将课堂上学到的知识应用到我们未来的职业中，并最终应用到我们的生活中。我在那门课上取得了A的好成绩，从中学到的人生经验让我在课堂之外受益匪浅。

Ten years after my chess class with Ashley, I’m still putting to use what he taught me: “The absolute most important skill that you learn when you play chess is how to make good decisions. On every single move, you have to analyze a situation, process what your opponent (对手) is doing and evaluate the best move from among all your options.”These words still ring true today in my role as a journalist.

在和阿什利一起上国际象棋课十年后，我仍然在用他教给我的东西:“下棋时你学到的最重要的技能是如何做出正确的决定。在每一步棋中，你都必须分析形势，处理对手的动作，并从所有选择中评估出最好的一步棋。”这句话至今在我作为一名记者的生活中仍然历历在目。
