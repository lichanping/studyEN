The Deceptive Journey
欺骗之旅

A businessman, with a lot of money, was walking through a remote(偏远的) area. Upon learning this, a thief followed him, planning to steal his money at a certain time. The businessman(商人) noticed something was strange and he started to pay much more attention to the thief. 

一个商人，有很多钱，走在一个偏远的地区。一听到这个消息，一个小偷就跟着他，计划在某个时间偷他的钱。商人注意到一些奇怪的事情，他开始更多地关注小偷。

The businessman asked the thief if he would help find some water nearby, and when the thief went to look for the water, the businessman put all of his money into the thief's bag. Then the thief returned and told the businessman where the water was. As soon as the businessman left to get some water, the thief quickly searched the businessman's bag. Certainly, there was nothing that the thief wanted. ​

商人问小偷是否可以帮他在附近找一些水，当小偷去找水时，商人把他所有的钱都放进了小偷的包里。然后小偷回来告诉商人水在哪里。当商人离开去取水时，小偷迅速搜查了商人的包。当然，没有小偷想要的东西。

The thief was surprised, but he still did not give up hope. After some time, the businessman returned and they both walked for a long time. Then the businessman got tired and slept under a big tree. The thief again checked the businessman's bag and still did not find any money. So the thief believed that the businessman did not actually have any money with him. 

小偷很惊讶，但他仍然没有放弃希望。过了一会儿，商人回来了，他们走了很长时间。然后商人累了，就在一棵大树下睡了。小偷再次检查商人的包，仍然没有找到任何钱。因此，小偷认为商人实际上并没有带钱。

Finally, they arrived at a city. When the thief went after a job and left his own bag behind, the businessman reached in and took back all of his own money he had put there formerly. ​When the thief came back, he was surprised to see that the businessman was buying some jewels with the money in his bag. The thief couldn't help asking the question, "I didn't know you had money on the trip. "​The businessman smiled to him, "Of course you didn't, because it is not yours. "

最后，他们到达了一座城市。当小偷去找一份工作而把自己的包落在了后面时，商人把手伸了进去，把自己先前放在里面的钱都拿了回来。当小偷回来时，他惊讶地发现商人正在用他包里的钱买一些珠宝。小偷忍不住问:“我不知道你旅行时带了钱。”​商人笑着对他说:“你当然没有，因为它不是你的。”
