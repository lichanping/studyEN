4.3.2.13_Taking the Wrong Bus
坐错车

This happened several weeks ago.On my way to work, I accidentally got on the wrong bus because I was reading the news on my phone.I had to get off and walk several blocks to work, a path I had never taken.

这件事发生在几周前。在上班的路上，我不小心上错了车，因为我正在看手机上的新闻。我不得不下车，步行几个街区去上班，这是一条我从未走过的路。

I met a man sitting on a bench looking very upset, so I asked him what was wrong.He said his car had been dragged away (拖走) from a public lot and that he had no money to get to the airport to meet his wife.I told him that I could help him out and let him wait there. 

我看到一个男人坐在长凳上，看起来很沮丧，所以我问他怎么了。他说他的车被从公共停车场拖走了，他没有钱去机场接他的妻子。我告诉他我可以帮他，让他在那里等着。

I went to the bank one block away and got cash.When I returned, the man was standing there, watching me approach him. When I gave him the cash, he hugged me, thanked me, and started crying! I nearly cried, too.I wished him to get to the airport safely, explained how he could take public transport to get there, and then continued to go to my office.

我去一个街区外的银行取了现金。当我回来的时候，那个人站在那里，看着我走近他。当我把钱给他时，他拥抱了我，感谢了我，然后哭了起来! 我也差点儿哭了。我希望他能平安到达机场，并向他解释如何乘坐公共交通工具到达机场，然后继续去我的办公室。

I stopped at my usual restaurant for a to go (带走的) breakfast and, at the door, I met another man who politely said, “Excuse me, sir.I don't want your money, but could you please help me get some food?”I said, “Of course, please come with me.”I ordered my breakfast and paid for this man's order.I wished him a wonderful day.

我在我常去的那家餐馆买了一份外带早餐，在门口，我遇到另一个男人，他礼貌地说:“对不起，先生。我不要你的钱，但你能帮我弄点吃的吗?”我说:“当然，请跟我来。”我点了早餐，付了这个人的钱。我祝他度过美好的一天。

As you may guess, I was so thankful for putting myself on the wrong bus at the right time.This let me meet two people who needed help and warmth. During each meeting, I never felt afraid; I only felt delighted to help them.

你可能猜到了，我很感激自己在正确的时间搭错了车。这让我遇到了两个需要帮助和温暖的人。在每次会面中，我从不感到害怕;我只觉得帮助他们很高兴。
