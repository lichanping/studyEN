弗雷迪

In 1973, I was teaching elementary school.Each day, 27 kids entered “The Thinking Laboratory.”That was the name students voted for after deciding that “Room 104” was too dull.

1973年，我在小学教书。每天有27个孩子进入“思维实验室”。这个名字由学生们投票选出因为他们认为“104室”太无趣了。

Freddy was an average student, but not an average person.He had the rare balance of fun and compassion（同情）.He would laugh the loudest over fun and be the saddest over anyone's misfortune.

弗雷迪是个普通的学生，但不是普通人。他有一种罕见的幽默感和同情心的平衡。他会因为开心的事情而笑得最大声，也会因为别人的不幸而伤心。

Before the school year ended, I gave the kids a special gift, T-shirts with the words “Verbs Are Your friends” on them.I had advised the kids that while verbs（动词）may seem dull, most of the fun things they do throughout their lives will be verbs.

在学年结束之前，我给了孩子们一份特别的礼物——印着“动词是你的朋友”的t恤。我曾告诉孩子们，虽然动词可能看起来很枯燥，但他们一生中做的大多数有趣的事情都将是动词。

Through the years, I'd run into former students who would provide updates on old classmates.I learned that Freddy did several jobs after his graduation from high school and remained the same caring person I met forty years before.Once, while working overnight at a store, he let a homeless man sleep in his truck.Another time, he lent a friend money to buy a house.

这些年来，我遇到过一些以前的学生，他们会提供老同学的最新情况。我了解到弗雷迪高中毕业后做了好几份工作，但他仍然是我40年前遇到的那个关心我的人。有一次，他在一家商店通宵工作，让一个无家可归的人睡在他的卡车里。还有一次，他借钱给朋友买房子。

Just last year, I was conducting a workshop when someone knocked at the classroom door.A woman excused the interruption and handed me an envelope.I stopped teaching and opened it up.Inside were the “Verbs” shirt and a note from Freddy's mother.“Freddy passed away on Thanksgiving. He wanted you to have this.”

就在去年，我正在开办讲习班时，这时有人敲教室的门。一位女士抱歉打扰我，递给我一个信封。我停止了上课，把它打开。里面是“动词”衬衫和弗雷迪母亲的一张纸条。“弗雷迪在感恩节去世了。他想把这个给你。”

I told the story to the class.As sad as it was, I couldn't help smiling.Although Freddy was taken from us, we all took something from Freddy.

我把这个故事讲给全班同学听。尽管很悲伤，我还是忍不住笑了。虽然弗雷迪从我们身边被夺走了，但我们都从弗雷迪身上得到了一些东西。
