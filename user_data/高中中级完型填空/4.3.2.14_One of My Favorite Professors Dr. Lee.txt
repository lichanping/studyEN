One of My Favorite Professors Dr.  Lee
我最喜欢的李教授

Dr.  Lee was one of my favorite professors in college. He was memorable because of a trick he employed at the beginning of his first class. “I will put a lie into each of my lectures.  Your job is to try and catch me in the Lie of the Day. ”

李博士是我大学时最喜欢的教授之一。他令人难忘是因为他在第一堂课开始时耍了一个小把戏。“我将在每节课中加入一个谎言。你的任务就是试着在《每日谎言》中抓住我。”

That was a brilliant way to focus our attention at the dry and boring subject—Capital Markets. On those days, we actively challenged Dr.  Lee's statements. Every once in a while, a lecture would end with nobody seeing through the lie. Dr.  Lee would say, “Ah ha! Each of you has a lie in your notes.  Discuss among yourselves what it might be, and I will tell you next Monday. ”

这是把我们的注意力集中在枯燥乏味的主题——资本市场上的一个绝妙方法。在那些日子里，我们积极地质疑李博士的言论。每隔一段时间，讲座就会在没有人识破谎言的情况下结束。李博士会说：“啊哈！你们每个人的笔记里都有一个谎言。你们自己商量一下，下星期一我就告诉你们。”

What made Dr. Lee's teaching technique smart was that there was no lie during the most technically difficult lecture.  He offered the same challenge to work on our lecture notes. On the following Monday, he would hear our theories for almost ten minutes before he finally said, “Do you remember the first lecture—how I said that every lecture has a lie?”. 

李博士的教学技巧高明之处在于，在技术上最困难的讲座中，他没有说谎。他也提出了同样的挑战，让我们做课堂笔记。在接下来的周一，他会听我们讲将近十分钟的理论，最后他说：“你们还记得第一节课吗?我说每一节课都有一个谎言。”

Tired from having our best theories shot down, we nodded.  

我们对自己最好的理论被驳倒感到厌倦，于是点了点头。

“Well, that was a lie.  My previous lecture was completely true and reliable.   But I am glad you reviewed your notes carefully this weekend.  Moving on. . . ”

“好吧，那是个谎言。我之前讲的是完全真实可靠的。但我很高兴你这个周末认真复习了笔记。继续……”

While my knowledge of the Capital Markets has faded over time, the lessons have stayed with me. “Experts” can be wrong and say things that sound right—so build a habit of evaluating new information and check it against things you already accept as fact. 

虽然随着时间的推移，我对资本市场的了解逐渐淡去，但这些经验教训一直伴随着我。“专家”可能是错的，也可能说的听起来是对的，所以要养成评估新信息的习惯，并将其与你已经接受的事实进行核对。
