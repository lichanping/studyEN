My Path to Growth
我的成长之路

When I was 13, my only purpose was to become the star on our football team. That meant beating out Miller King, who was the best player at our school. 

当我13岁的时候，我唯一的目标就是成为我们足球队的明星。这意味着要打败米勒·金，他是我们学校最好的球员。

Football season started in September and all summer long I worked out. I carried my football everywhere for practice.  

足球赛季从9月开始，整个夏天我都在锻炼。我带着我的足球到处练习。

Just before September, Miller was struck by a car and lost his right arm. I went to see him after he came back from hospital.   He looked very pale, but he didn't cry. 

就在九月前，米勒被车撞了，失去了右臂。他从医院回来后我去看了他。他看起来很苍白，但没有哭。

That season, I broke all of Miller's records while he watched the home games from the bench. We went 10-1 and I was named most valuable player, but I often had crazy dreams in which I was to blame for Miller's accident.  

那个赛季，当米勒坐在替补席上观看主场比赛时，我打破了他所有的记录。我们10胜1负，我被评为最有价值球员，但我经常做疯狂的梦，梦里我要为米勒的意外负责。

One afternoon, I was crossing the field to go home and saw Miller stuck going over a fence—which wasn't hard to climb if you had both arms. I'm sure I was the last person in the world he wanted to accept assistance from.  But even that challenge he accepted. I helped him move slowly over the fence. When we were finally safe on the other side, he said to me,＂You know, I didn't tell you this during the season, but you did fine.   Thank you for filling in for me. " 

一天下午，我穿过球场回家，看见米勒在翻过栅栏时被卡住了——如果你有两只胳膊的话，爬栅栏并不难。我肯定我是他最不愿意接受帮助的人。但即使是这样的挑战，他也接受了。我帮他慢慢地翻过栅栏。当我们最终安全到达另一边时，他对我说:“你知道，赛季期间我没有告诉你这些，但你做得很好。谢谢你代替我。”

His words freed me from my bad dreams.  I thought to myself, how even without an arm he was more of a leader. Damaged but not defeated, he was still ahead of me. I was right to have admired him.  From that day on, I grew bigger and a little more real. 

他的话把我从噩梦中解救了出来。我心想，即使没有胳膊，他也更像个领袖。受损但没有被打败，他仍然领先于我。我钦佩他是对的。从那天起，我长大了，也变得更加真实。
