花

Most people in school liked Gloria.So when she got sick, some boys planned to visit her.But none of them wanted to spend any money for a gift to bring along.

学校里大多数人都喜欢格洛丽亚。所以当她生病时，一些男孩计划去看望她。但是没有一个人愿意花钱买礼物。

Then Willie said, “We can steal some flowers from a grave." 

然后威利说：“我们可以从坟墓里偷一些花。”

Gloria will not know where they come from, and the dead man will not hate them. 

格洛丽亚不会知道他们从哪里来，死人也不会恨他们。

Everybody was afraid, except Willie. So he went alone and found some beautiful flowers.Then they went to Gloria's room, and the boys acted as if the flowers were from all of them, but nobody did not mind.

除了威利，每个人都很害怕。于是他一个人去了，发现了一些美丽的花。然后他们去了格洛丽亚的房间，男孩们表现得好像这些花是他们所有人送的，但没有人介意。

After their visit, Willie said to the other boys, “It is a good thing that I was not afraid.  Gloria liked the flowers.”

在他们拜访之后，威利对其他男孩说：“我没有害怕是件好事。格洛丽亚喜欢这些花。”

The other boys laughed.Gloria would not have liked the flowers if she had known they had come from a grave.

其他男孩都笑了。如果格洛丽亚知道这些花是从坟墓里长出来的，她是不会喜欢的。

That night, Willie was reading a book when his mother came into his room.“Willie, did you and other boys buy some flowers today for Gloria? ” she asked.“There's a man outside asking for you,” she added.“He says that you didn't pay for the flowers.”

那天晚上，威利正在看书，这时他妈妈走进了他的房间。“威利，你和其他男孩今天给格洛丽亚买花了吗?”她问。“外面有个人找你，”她补充说。“他说你没有付钱买花。”

“What does he look like?" Willie asked.

“他长什么样?”威利问道。

“That's hard to say,” Willie's mother answered. “He is all covered with mud.”

“这很难说，”威利的妈妈回答。 “他浑身都是泥。”

Willie, all of a sudden, turned pale.

威利突然脸色发白。
