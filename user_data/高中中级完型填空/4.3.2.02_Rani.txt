Rani
兰妮

Hundreds of people have formed impressions of you through that little device (装置) on your desk. And they’ve never actually met you. Everything they know about you came through this device, sometimes from hundreds of miles away. Yet they feel they can know you just from the sound of your voice. That’s how powerful the telephone is. 

成百上千的人通过你桌上的那个小装置对你形成了印象。他们从来没见过你。他们对你的一切了解都来自这个装置，有时是从几百英里外传来的。然而，他们觉得他们可以通过你的声音来了解你。这就是电话的威力。

Powerful, yes, but not always accurate. For years, I dealt with my travel agent only by phone. Rani, my faceless agent whom I’d never met in person, got me rock-bottom prices on airfares, cars, and hotels. But her cold voice really annoyed me. I sometimes wished to find another agent. 

强大，是的，但并不总是准确的。多年来，我只通过电话与我的旅行社打交道。我素未谋面的经纪人拉尼为我提供了最低价格的机票、汽车和酒店。但她冷漠的声音真的让我很恼火。有时我希望再找一个代理人。

One morning, I had to book an immediate flight home for a family emergency. I ran into Rani’s office for the first time. The woman sitting at the desk, seeing my madness, sympathetically jumped up. She gave me a comforting smile, nodded while listening patiently, and then printed out the ticket immediately. ＂What a wonderful lady!＂ I thought. 

一天早上，因为家里有急事，我不得不订一张回家的直飞机票。我第一次跑进拉尼的办公室。坐在桌子旁的女人看到我的疯狂，同情地跳了起来。她给了我一个安慰的微笑，耐心地听着点了点头，然后马上把票打印出来。“真是一位了不起的女士!”我想。

Rushing out gratefully, I called out over my shoulder, " By the way, what’s your name?" " I’m Rani," she said. I turned around and saw a pleasant woman with a big smile on her face waving to wish me a safe trip. I was speechless! Why had I thought she was cold? Rani was, well, so nice. 

我感激地冲出去，扭头喊道:“对了，你叫什么名字?”我是拉尼，”她说。我转过身，看见一位和蔼可亲的女士，脸上挂着灿烂的笑容，挥手祝我旅途平安。我无语了!为什么我觉得她很冷漠?拉尼人很好。

Sitting back in the car on the way to the airport, I figured it all out. Rani’s friendliness — her warm smile, her nods, her ‘I’m here for you’ attitude — were all silent signals that didn’t travel through wires. 

在去机场的路上，我坐在车里，把一切都想明白了。拉尼的友好——她温暖的微笑，她的点头，她“我在这里为你”的态度——都是无声的信号，不会通过电线传播。
