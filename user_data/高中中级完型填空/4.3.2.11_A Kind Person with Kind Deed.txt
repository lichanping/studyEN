善良的人 & 善举

Catherine is in the final year of her doctoral program in physical therapy (治疗), and determined Lawrence McNutt, aged 73, is one of her patients.She's known he's had the will to get well again, so when he fell down while using his walker, she was sure he would be anxious to get right back up again.

凯瑟琳的物理治疗博士课程即将进入最后一年(治疗), 并确定73岁的劳伦斯·麦克纳特是她的病人之一。她知道他有恢复健康的意愿，所以当他在使用助行器时摔倒时，她确信他渴望重新站起来。

However, the only problem wasn't that he Suddenly couldn't walk, but that he was using a walker that was too small for him.He needed a wider frame to provide more stability for him, but walkers aren't cheap and insurance isn't always helpful with medical equipment.

然而，唯一的问题不是他突然不能走路，而是他使用的助行器对他来说太小了。他需要一个更宽松的框架来为他提供更多的稳定性，但助行器并不便宜，而且医疗设备也不是很保险。

Thanks to Catherine's efforts, Lawrence is in possession of a new walker, completely free of charge!

多亏了凯瑟琳的努力，劳伦斯免费拥有一个新的助行器！

How did she make it?She took it upon herself to use the power of social media.Now she is changing more senior citizens who need medical equipment like walkers, and wheelchairs.These days, I've seen many problems in our neighborhood, such as patients having broken brakes on their wheelchairss," she wrote on a social website and posted some pictures to show the seriousness.

她是怎么做到的呢？她主动利用社交媒体的力量。孔奶奶的故事触动了许多人的心灵。这些天，我在我们的社区看到了很多问题，比如病人的轮椅刹车出现故障，”她在社交网站上写道，并发布了一些照片来显示其严重性。

This is all increasing their risk of falls.People living in low-income areas like ours can't afford the necessary equipment.She appealed to people, friends and family members to donate their unused equipment or donate through her GoFundMe to help purchase them instead.

这些都增加了他们跌落的风险。生活在像我们这样的低收入地区的人们买不起必要的设备。她呼吁人们、朋友和家人捐赠他们未使用的设备，或者通过她的GoFundMe捐款帮助购买。

Since her initial request, she has already received positive responses and collected more than 50 pieces of medical tools for the patients.

从最初的请求开始，她已经收到了积极的回复，并为患者收集了 50 多件医疗工具。

Catherine has done such deeds even before completing her program.With her commitment to her work, there's no telling how much more motivation she will put into the world!

凯瑟琳甚至在完成她的项目之前就做过这样的事。由于她对工作的投入，不知道她能够给这个世界带来多大的动力！
