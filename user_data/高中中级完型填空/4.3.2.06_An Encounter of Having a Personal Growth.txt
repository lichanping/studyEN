4.3.2.06_An Encounter of Having a Personal Growth Plan
一次与个人成长计划的邂逅

Years ago, acritical event occurred in my life that would change it forever.I met Kurt Kampmeir of Success Motivation Incorporation for breakfast.While we were eating, Kurt asked me, "John, what is your plan for personal growth?"

几年前，我生命中发生了一件重要的事情，它将永远改变我的生活。我和成功动机公司的Kurt Kampmeir共进早餐。吃饭的时候，库尔特问我:“约翰，你的个人成长计划是什么?”

Never at a loss for words, I tried to find things in my life that might qualify for growth.I told him about the many activities in which I was involved. And I went into a speech about how hard I worked and the gains I was making.I must have talked for ten minutes.Kurt listened patiently, but then he finally smiled and said, “You don't have a personal plan for growth, do you?”

我从不无言以对，我试着在生活中寻找可能有成长的东西。我告诉他我参加过的许多活动。我发表了一篇关于我如何努力工作和我所取得的成就的演讲。我一定讲了十分钟。库尔特耐心地听着，但最后他笑着说:“你没有个人的成长计划，是吗?”

“No, I admitted." 

“不，我承认。”

"You know,” Kurt said simply, “growth is not an automatic process." 

“你知道，”库尔特简单地说，“成长不是一个自动的过程。” 

And that's when it hit me. I wasn't doing anything on purpose to make myself better.And at that moment, I made the decision: I will develop and follow a personal growth plan for my life. 

就在那时，我突然意识到。我没有刻意做任何事来让自己变得更好。在那一刻，我做了一个决定:我要为我的生活制定并遵循一个个人成长计划。

That night, I talked to my wife about my conversation with Kurt and what I had learned.I showed her the workbook and tapes Kurt was selling.We recognized that Kurt wasn't just trying to make a sale.He was offering a way for us to change our lives and achieve our dreams.

那天晚上，我和妻子谈到了我和库尔特的谈话，以及我学到的东西。我给她看了库尔特卖的练习册和磁带。我们意识到库尔特不只是想做成一笔买卖。他为我们提供了一条改变生活、实现梦想的道路。

Several important things happened that day. First, we decided to buy resources. But more importantly, we made a commitment to grow together as a couple. From that day on, we learned together, traveled together, and sacrificed together. It was a wise decision. While too many couples grew apart, we were growing together.

那天发生了几件重要的事情。首先，我们决定购买资源。但更重要的是，我们承诺要像夫妻一样共同成长。从那天起，我们一起学习，一起旅行，一起牺牲。这是一个明智的决定。当太多的夫妻分手时，我们却在一起成长。
