最伟大的时刻

The journey my daughter Cathy has had with her swimming is as long as it is beautiful.

我女儿凯茜的游泳之旅是美丽的，只要它是美丽的。

Cathy suffered some terrible illness her early childhood.After years of regular treatment, she finally became healthy.

凯茜在童年早期得了一场可怕的病。经过多年的定期治疗，她终于恢复了健康。

Two years ago, while Cathy was watching the Olympics, a dream came into her sweet little head—to be a swimmer.Last summer, she wanted to join a local swim team.She practiced hard and finally made it.The team practice, however, had a rough start.She coughed and choked and could hardly survive her first few weeks.Hearing her coughing bitterly one night, I decided to pull her from it all.But Cathy woke me up early the next morning, wearing her swimsuit ready to go!I told her she shouldn't swim after a whole night's coughing, but she refused to give up and insisted she go.

两年前，当凯茜在看奥运会时，一个梦想进入了她可爱的小脑袋——成为一名游泳运动员。去年夏天，她想加入当地的游泳队。她努力练习，终于成功了。然而，球队的训练开局并不顺利。她咳嗽、窒息，头几个星期几乎活不下去。一天晚上听到她咳嗽得很厉害，我决定把她从这一切中拉出来。但是凯西第二天一大早就把我叫醒了，她穿着泳衣准备出发!她咳嗽了一整夜，我告诉她不要去游泳，但她拒绝放弃，坚持要去。

From that day on, Cathy kept swimming and didn't miss a single practice.She had a firm intention within herself to be the best she could be.My ten-year-old was growing and changing right before my eyes, into this determined human being with a passion and a mission.There were moments of frustration, of course: often she would be the last swimmer in the race.It was difficult for Cathy to accept that she wasn't a winner —ever.But that didn't stop her from trying.

从那天起，凯茜坚持游泳，没有错过任何一次练习。她内心有一个坚定的愿望，那就是尽她所能做到最好。我十岁的孩子就在我眼前成长和改变，成为一个有激情和使命的坚定的人。当然，她也有沮丧的时候:她经常是比赛中最后一个游泳者。凯茜很难接受她从来都不是赢家的事实。但这并没有阻止她继续尝试。

Then came the final awards ceremony at the end of the year.Cathy didn't expect any awards but was still there to cheer on her friends and praise their accomplishments.As the ceremony was nearing the end, I suddenly heard the head coach admitting, “The highest honor goes to Cathy!” .Looking around, he continued, “Cathy has inspired us with her will and enthusiasm.”Although skills and talents bring great success, the most valuable asset(财富)one can hold is the heart.

然后是年终的颁奖典礼。凯茜并没有期待任何奖励，但她仍然在那里为她的朋友们加油，赞扬他们的成就。当仪式接近尾声时，我突然听到主教练承认:“最高荣誉属于凯茜!”。他环顾四周，继续说道:“凯茜用她的意志和热情激励着我们。虽然技能和才华能带来巨大的成功，但一个人能拥有的最宝贵的资产是心。

It was the greatest moment of my daughter's life.With all she had been through in her ten years, this was the hour of true triumph(成功).

那是我女儿一生中最伟大的时刻。考虑到她这十年来所经历的一切，这是她真正胜利的时刻。
