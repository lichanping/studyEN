Gabriel
加布里埃尔

For a long time, Gabriel didn't want to be involved in music at all. In his first years of high school, Gabriel would look pityingly at music students, struggling across the campus with their heavy instrument cases, turning up at school for practice hours before anyone else had to be there. He swore to himself to avoid music, as he hated getting to school extra early. 

很长一段时间，加布里埃尔根本不想参与音乐。在上高中的头几年，加布里埃尔总是可怜地看着学音乐的学生，他们扛着沉重的乐器箱在校园里吃力地走着，比别人早几个小时到学校练习。他对自己发誓不听音乐，因为他讨厌上学太早。

However，one day，in the music class that was spirit of his school's standard curriculum，he was playing idly （随意地）on the piano and found it easy to pick out tunes. With a sinking feeling, he realized that he actually enjoyed doing it. He tried to hide his obvious pleasure from the music teacher, who had wandered over to listen. He might not have done this particularly well, because the teacher told Gabriel that he had a good taste and suggested that Gabriel go into the music store-room to see if any of the instruments there appealed to him. There he decided to give the cello（大提琴）a chance. When he began practicing, he took it very casually. But he quickly found that he loved playing this instrument, and was committed to practicing it so that within a couple of months he was playing reasonably well. 

然而，有一天，在音乐课上(这是学校标准课程的精髓)，他悠闲地弹着钢琴，发现很容易就能挑出曲调。带着一种不祥的感觉，他意识到他其实很喜欢做这件事。他试图掩饰他明显的喜悦，不让音乐老师看见，因为他正走过来听他说话。他可能做得不是特别好，因为老师告诉盖伯瑞尔，他很有鉴赏力，并建议盖伯瑞尔到乐器储藏室去看看有没有他喜欢的乐器。在那里，他决定给大提琴一个机会。当他开始练习时，他很随意。但他很快发现他喜欢演奏这种乐器，并致力于练习，所以在几个月之内，他弹得相当好。

This meant, of course, that he arrived at school early in the morning, dragging his heavy instrument case across the campus to the pitying looks of the non-musicians he had left behind. 

当然，这意味着他一大早就到学校，拖着沉重的乐器箱穿过校园，面对那些被他留在身后的非音乐家们可怜的表情。
