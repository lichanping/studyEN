You think in the way you do things. If you don't give your hundred percent in a relationship, you'll always keep thinking if the other person has given his or her hundred percent. This is true for any relationship. 

你思考的方式就是你做事的方式。如果你在一段关系中没有百分之百地付出，你就会一直想着对方是否已经百分之百地付出了。这适用于任何关系。

Give your hundred percent to everything you do and you'll find that you can always get a lot of happiness. 

对你所做的每件事都百分之百地投入，你会发现你总能得到很多快乐。
