Potatoes
土豆

A kindergarten teacher decided to have her class play a game. The teacher told each student to bring a plastic bag with a few potatoes in it to school. Each student would "name" their potatoes after people they did not like. Therefore，the number of potatoes would be different depending on how many people each student hated. 

一位幼儿园老师决定让她的班级玩一个游戏。老师让每个学生带一个塑料袋，里面装几个土豆到学校。每个学生都会用他们不喜欢的人的名字给他们的土豆“命名”。因此，土豆的数量会根据每个学生讨厌多少人而有所不同。

The next day, with their potatoes, all the students went to school to join in the game. Some kids had just one or two potatoes, while others had as many as five or six. The teacher then told the children that they would have to carry their potatoes with them wherever they went for one week. 

第二天，所有的学生都带着土豆去学校参加游戏。一些孩子只吃了一两个土豆，而另一些孩子则吃了五六个。然后老师告诉孩子们，他们必须在一个星期内随身携带土豆。

Several days passed by.  Some of the students started to complain(抱怨), as their potatoes began to rot(腐烂)and smell bad. The students who carried more potatoes began to get unsatisfied with the heavy bags. 

几天过去了。一些学生开始抱怨，因为他们的土豆开始腐烂，而且闻起来很臭。背土豆多的学生开始对沉重的袋子感到不满。

One week later, the game was over. The teacher asked, "How did you feel like carrying around your potatoes for a week?"

一周后，比赛结束了。老师问:“你觉得带着土豆的这一个星期怎么样?”

The students complained once again. The teacher simply smiled and said, "This is what it's like to carry hatred(仇恨 )in your heart. You have to carry it with you wherever you go.  If you can′t tolerate (容忍) carrying rotten potatoes for one week, how can you imagine having hate in your heart for a whole lifetime? Forgive others and move on with your life. "

学生们又开始抱怨了。老师只是笑着说:“这就是把仇恨放在心里的感觉。无论你走到哪里，你都得带着它。如果你都不能忍受背一个星期的烂土豆，你又怎么能想象一辈子心中都有仇恨呢?原谅别人，继续你的生活。”
