Mr.Black
布莱克先生

Mr.Black was a wealthy businessman, but he was not satisfied with his life. He always tried his best to make more money for his company. He did not sleep well and his food did not agree with him. The situation lasted for some time. 

布莱克先生是一位富有的商人，但他对自己的生活并不满意。他总是竭尽全力为公司赚更多的钱。他睡得不好，饮食也不合他的胃口。这种情况持续了一段时间。

Finally, after a number of sleepless nights, he decided to see his doctor. The doctor advised a change of surroundings. "Go abroad," he said. "But I'm not good at foreign languages, "said Mr. Black. "It doesn't matter," said the doctor.  "It won't hurt you if you talk a little less. Go on a trip. Take plenty of exercise. Try to lose weight. Avoid eating rich food. "

经过几个不眠之夜后，他终于决定去看医生。医生建议换个环境。“出国吧，”他说。“但是我不擅长外语，”布莱克先生说。“这没关系，”医生说。”如果你少说话一点，也不会伤害到你的。去旅行吧。做大量的锻炼。试着减肥。避免吃丰富的食物。”

Mr. Black went to Switzerland. He did not know French or German, and had to express himself through gestures. He took part in a physical training course. The instructor made him shake his head, swing his arms, stretch his neck and bend his knees. He had to lie on the ground and raise his right and left legs in turn. After some time, his muscles grew hard and firm. He almost put aside his financial worries and nearly forgot the importance of making more money. He even began to notice trees and birds. He ate and slept well. Finally, he returned home. But unfortunately, his improvement did not last long. Soon he was a normal businessman again, worried about his wealth, his savings, his success in a competitive society, and things in general. 

布莱克先生去了瑞士。他既不懂法语，也不懂德语，只好用手势来表达自己的意思。他参加了体能训练课程。教练让他摇头，摆动手臂，伸展脖子，弯曲膝盖。他不得不躺在地上，轮流抬起左腿和右腿。过了一段时间，他的肌肉变得又硬又结实。他几乎抛开了经济上的担忧，几乎忘记了赚更多钱的重要性。他甚至开始注意到树和鸟。他吃得睡得很好。最后，他回到了家。但不幸的是，他的进步并没有持续多久。很快，他又变成了一个普通的商人，为自己的财富、积蓄、在竞争激烈的社会中取得的成功以及所有的事情而担忧。
