Thanksgiving
感恩节

It was Thanksgiving. Snow was falling when Bob drove towards the city park. Bob was deserted by his parents and was raised by a kind man. Two years ago, to be thankful, Bob built a tradition. That was to take his Thanksgiving dinner to the park to share with a homeless person. 

那是感恩节。鲍勃开车去城市公园时正在下雪。鲍勃被父母遗弃，由一个善良的人抚养长大。两年前，为了感恩，鲍勃建立了一个传统。那是带他的感恩节晚餐去公园和一个无家可归的人分享。

The park was empty. Everyone was home enjoying their dinner. After arriving at the park, Bob saw an old woman sitting on a bench. Bob stopped his car in a parking place and got out. He took the food from the front seat and began walking towards her. When he stood beside her, she jumped as if she had suddenly been woken up from sleeping. She looked up at Bob, and then her eyes brightened. 

公园里空无一人。每个人都在家里享用晚餐。到达公园后，鲍勃看到一位老妇人坐在长凳上。鲍勃把车停在一个停车场，下了车。他从前排座位上拿起食物，开始向她走去。当他站在她身边时，她跳了起来，仿佛突然从睡梦中惊醒。她抬头看着鲍勃，然后她的眼睛亮了起来。

"Good evening, madam," Bob said, smiling.  "I've brought you some Thanksgiving dinner.  Would you like to share it with me?"The woman nodded and Bob served her the food and then watched her as she ate happily. When the woman finished, he cleared the table.  Then he took twenty dollars out of his wallet. 

“晚上好，夫人，”鲍勃微笑着说。“我给你带了一些感恩节晚餐。你愿意和我一起分享吗?”女人点了点头，鲍勃把食物端给她，然后看着她开心地吃着。女人吃完后，他收拾了桌子。然后他从钱包里拿出20美元。

He put the money into her hand. Then he kissed her lightly on the forehead and said, "Thank you for sharing my Thanksgiving dinner. "With that, he took his dishes from the table and returned to the car. 

他把钱放在她手里。然后他轻轻地吻了一下她的额头，说：“谢谢你和我一起吃感恩节晚餐。”说完，他从桌上拿起盘子，回到车上。
