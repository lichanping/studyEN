Art experts(专家)say that the movement began in New York in the 1960s. Young adults would use paint in special cans to put their words and other images on walls and cars around the city. One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images(形象)of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art, but as time went on, she got bored with the works she saw in museums or galleries (画廊). The people in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and interesting style.
