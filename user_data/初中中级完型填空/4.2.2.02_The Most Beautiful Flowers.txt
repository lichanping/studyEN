The Most Beautiful Flowers
最美的花

What is the most beautiful flower in the world?Do you know?Peony, rose or violet?You may give me a list of the names of different flowers. I once asked my mother the same question. 

世界上最美丽的花是什么?你知道吗?牡丹、玫瑰还是紫罗兰?你可以给我一份不同花名的清单。我曾经问过我妈妈同样的问题。

Looking at me with a big smile, she answered, "My child, as for the parents, children's smiling faces are the most beautiful flowers in the world. "

她笑着看着我，回答说:“孩子，对于父母来说，孩子的笑脸是世界上最美丽的花朵。”

Our smiling faces are the most beautiful flowers in the world for our parents?Are we generous enough to give the most beautiful flowers to them every day?In the morning, we eat the food that mother prepares for us, impatient to respond to her words. In the evening, we leave the broken bike to our father and think it is the most natural thing to find a repaired one the next morning. We pay too much attention to things of our own. We are used to what our parents do for us. We even forget to do the smallest thing to satisfy them. We said too many times "I will…", but we forget that we are really able to do many things for our parents right now. 

对父母来说，我们的笑脸是世界上最美丽的花朵。我们是否足够慷慨，每天都把最美的花送给他们?早上，我们吃着妈妈给我们准备的食物，迫不及待地回应她的话。晚上，我们把坏掉的自行车留给爸爸，认为第二天早上找到一辆修好的是最自然的事情。我们太关注自己的事情了。我们已经习惯了父母为我们做的一切。我们甚至忘记做一件最小的事情来满足他们。我们说了太多次“我会……”，但我们忘记了我们现在真的可以为父母做很多事情。

My friends, if you did not spend too much time thinking about your parents, think about them now. You are sure to find how kind, how patient and how great they are. Next time when you see them, smile from your heart. That is the most precious(珍贵的)gift for them. 

我的朋友们，如果你以前没有花太多时间想着你的父母，现在想想他们吧。你一定会发现他们是多么善良，多么有耐心，多么伟大。下次当你看到他们的时候，发自内心地微笑。那对他们来说是最珍贵的礼物。
