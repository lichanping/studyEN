A Story of Box
一个箱子的故事

A man was walking along the street when he saw a woman struggling（奋力前进） with a large box. It was half in and half out of her car. He was a helpful and kind man, so he went up to the woman and said, "Let me give you a hand with that box.  It looks very heavy. "

一个男人在街上走着，这时他看到一个女人正在奋力拿着一个大箱子。它一半在她车里，一半在车外。他是一个乐于助人、善良的人，所以他走到女人面前说：“让我帮你拿那个箱子。”它看起来很重。”

"That's very kind of you," the woman said.  "I'm having a lot of trouble with it.  I think it's stuck（卡住）. ""Together we'll soon move it," the man said. He got into the back seat of the car and took hold of the other end of the box. He said, "I'm ready. " And he began to push hard. 

“你真是太好了，”女人说。“它给我带来了太多麻烦了。我觉得它卡住了。”“我们一起很快就能把它搬走。”男人说。他坐到汽车后座上，抓住箱子的另一端。他说，我准备好了。”他开始使劲推。

For several minutes, the man and the woman struggled with the box. Soon they were red in the face. "Let's rest for a minute," the man said.  "I'm sorry, but it seems stuck. "A few minutes later, the man said,"Let's try again.  Are you ready?"Both of them took hold of the box again. "One, two, three! " the man said, and they went on with their struggle. 

有好几分钟，男人和女人都在搬那个箱子。很快他们的脸就热红了。“让我们休息一会儿，”男人说。“对不起，它好像卡住了。”几分钟后，那人说:“我们再试一次。你准备好了吗?”他们俩又抓住了箱子。“一，二，三!”那男的说，他们继续发力。

At last, when they were very tired, the man said,"You are right.  It is really stuck.  I don't think there's any way we can get it out of the car. ”"Get it out of the car?" the woman cried," I'm trying to get it in!"

最后，当他们很累的时候，男的说:“你说得对。它真的卡住了。我认为我们没有办法把它从车里拿出来。”“从车里拿出来?”女人叫道，“我要把它塞进去!”
