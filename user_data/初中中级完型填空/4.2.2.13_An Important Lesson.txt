An Important Lesson
重要的一课

One day, I picked up my daughter Eloise from school and went to the supermarket for a few things. I was hoping to be in and out quickly. 

一天，我去学校接女儿埃洛伊丝，然后去超市买了一些东西。我本来希望能很快进出的。

I found a short line with just one person in front of me. It was a/an old woman, and she was paying for her things with only change. After a long day at work, I was unhappy with this old woman. 

我发现队伍很短，前面只有一个人。那是一位老妇人，她正在用零钱付账。在漫长的一天工作之后，我对这个老妇人很不满意。

But then I watched the young clerk(职员). He helped her count her change, so carefully taking it from her shaking hands. I listened to him repeatedly(重复地) say to her: “Yes, madam. ”When she asked if she had enough to buy a bag, he told her she did. Then he went two lines over to get one for her. Never once did this clerk get annoyed or roll his eyes. He was patient and kind. 

但后来我看到了那个年轻的职员。他帮她数零钱，小心翼翼地从她颤抖的手中接过零钱。我听他反复对她说:“是的，夫人。”当她问她是否有足够的钱买一个包时，他告诉她有。然后他走了两行，给她取了一条。这个职员从来没有生气过，也没有翻白眼。他既耐心又善良。

As I was watching him, I saw Eloise was too. I realized that my daughter was learning an important lesson from a complete stranger. 

当我看着他的时候，我发现埃洛伊丝也是。我意识到我的女儿正在从一个完全陌生的人那里学到重要的一课。

After the woman was finished, the clerk began ringing up (把……的费用相加) my things and thanked me for my patience. I thanked him too. 

女服务员结账后，店员开始清点我的东西，并感谢我的耐心。我也感谢了他。

Then we left the supermarket with a full bag, but also with a heart full of thankfulness for such an important lesson. 

然后，我们带着满满一袋东西离开了超市，但也对如此重要的一课充满了感激之情。
