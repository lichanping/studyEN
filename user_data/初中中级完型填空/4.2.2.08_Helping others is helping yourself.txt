Helping others is helping yourself
帮助他人就是帮自己

One day, a man saw an old lady standing by her car on the side of the road. He could see that she needed help. So he stopped his car in front of her and got out. 

一天，一个人看见一位老太太站在她的车旁。他看得出她需要帮助。于是他把车停在她面前下了车。

Even though the man had a smile on his face, the old lady was worried. "No one had stopped helping for the last hour. Was he going to hurt me?He didn't look safe, he looked poor and hungry.  "the old lady thought. 

尽管那人脸上带着微笑，老太太还是很担心。“在最后一个小时里，没有人停止帮忙。他会伤害我吗？他看上去并不安全，他看上去又穷又饿。”老太太想。

He could see that she was worried. So he said,"I am here to help you, madam.  It seems that you have a flat tire(车胎漏气). Why don't you wait in the car where it's warm while I change the tire for you?By the way, my name is Bryant Anderson. ​"Though feeling doubtful, the old lady got into her car. 

他看得出来她很担心。于是他说：“我是来帮你的，夫人。你的轮胎好像没气了。你为什么不在暖和的车里等我给你换轮胎呢?顺便说一下，我叫布莱恩特·安德森。”老太太虽然有些怀疑，但还是上了车。

About 20 minutes later, he was done.  The old lady asked Bryant how much she should pay. Bryant never thought about being paid. He told her that if she really wanted to pay him back, the next time she saw someone who needed help, she could give that person her help. By the way, my name is Bryant Anderson. Though feeling doubtful, the old lady got into her car. 

大约20分钟后，他完成了任务。老太太问布莱恩特她该付多少钱。布莱恩特从来没有想过拿薪水。他告诉她，如果她真的想报答他，下次她看到有人需要帮助时，她可以帮助那个人。顺便说一下，我叫布莱恩特·安德森。老太太虽然有些怀疑，但还是上了车。

The man waited until the lady started her car and drove off. It was a cold day, but he felt good as he went on his way home. 

这个男人一直等到那位女士发动车开走了。天气很冷，但他在回家的路上感觉很好。
