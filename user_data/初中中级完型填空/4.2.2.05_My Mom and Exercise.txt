My Mom and Exercise
我的母亲和运动

Since my mother moved to live with us in the city, she has been much heavier than before. 

自从我妈妈搬来和我们一起住在城里，她比以前胖多了。

As time went by, her health got worse. So I had to take her to see a doctor. My mother was told to lose weight by doing exercise every day. She had no choice but to follow what the doctor said. I told her that I would exercise with her every morning. 

随着时间的流逝，她的健康状况越来越差。所以我不得不带她去看医生。我妈妈被告知要通过每天锻炼来减肥。她别无选择，只能照医生说的去做。我告诉她我每天早上都会和她一起锻炼。

On the first morning, she got up very early and ran with me in our neighborhood. I tried to run slowly so that she could follow me. After running for some minutes, I told her the proper ways of exercise and the importance of eating healthy food. She listened to me carefully. It made me remember that she told me everything very patiently when I was a kid. On the second morning, I praised her for keeping running with me. 

第一天早上，她起得很早，和我在小区里跑步。我试着跑得慢一点，以便她能跟上我。跑了几分钟后，我告诉她正确的运动方式和吃健康食物的重要性。她认真地听我说。这让我想起当我还是个孩子的时候，她非常耐心地告诉我一切。第二天早上，我称赞她一直和我一起跑。

But after two weeks, she wanted to give up running because she thought the two week exercise didn't work at all. To encourage her, I taught her how to use the facilities（设施）for exercise in our neighborhood. She began to exercise again. 

但两周后，她想放弃跑步，因为她认为这两周的锻炼根本不起作用。为了鼓励她，我教她如何使用我们社区的设施进行锻炼。她又开始锻炼了。

With my help, it took her one month to develop a good habit of daily exercise. "Thank you, my dear daughter.  Exercise brings health and happiness to me.  I will never worry about my health. ”Her words touched my heart deeply. I felt happy to make a big difference to my mother's life. 

在我的帮助下，她花了一个月的时间养成了每天锻炼的好习惯。“谢谢你，我亲爱的女儿。运动给我带来健康和快乐。我永远不会担心我的健康。”她的话深深地打动了我的心。我很高兴能给母亲的生活带来很大的改变。
