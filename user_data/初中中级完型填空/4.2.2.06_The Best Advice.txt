The Best Advice
最好的建议

When I was about 14, I had a friend who liked to tell me my shortcoming(缺点). For example: I was very short, I wasn't a top student, I talked too much, I was too proud and so on. I became so angry that I couldn't stand her at last. I ran to my father with tears in my eyes. 

大约14岁的时候，我有一个朋友，他喜欢告诉我我的缺点。例如：我很矮，我不是一个优等生，我说话太多，我太骄傲等等。我非常生气，再也忍受不了她了。我眼泪汪汪地跑向父亲。

He listened to me quietly and asked, "Are the thing she says true or not? Jane, didn't you ever wonder what you're really like? Go and make a list of everything she said and mark the points that are true.  Pay no attention to the other things she said. "I did as he told . To my great surprise, I discovered that about half the things were true. Some I couldn't change, like being very short. But many I could and I wanted to change. For the first time, I have a better understanding of myself. 

他静静地听着我说，问道:“她说的是真的还是假的?简，你就没想过你到底是什么样的人吗?去把她说的每句话都列出来，并在正确的地方做上记号。不要理会她说的其他事情。”我照他说的做了。令我吃惊的是，我发现大约一半的事情是对的。有些是我无法改变的，比如个子很矮。但有很多我可以改变，我也想改变。第一次，我对自己有了更好的了解。

I brought the list back to Daddy.  He refused to read it. "That's just for you," he said, "You know better than any other person the truth about yourself.  When something said about you is true, you'll find it will be of help to you.  Don't shut your ears.  Listen to them all, but only hear the truth and do what you know.  It is the right thing to do. "

我把单子给爸爸带回来了。他拒绝读它。“那是给你的，”他说，“你比任何人都更了解你自己的真相。当别人说的关于你的事情是真的，你会发现它对你有帮助。别闭上你的耳朵。他们都要听，但只听真话，做你知道的事。这是正确的做法。”

Daddy's advice has returned to me at many important moments. In my life, I've never had a better piece of advice. 

在很多重要时刻都让我想起爸爸的建议。在我的一生中，我从来没有得到过比这更好的建议。
