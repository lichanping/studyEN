澳大利亚的白色圣诞节

You often see people in movies celebrating a white Christmas in England or the United States. But Christmas in Australia is very different. 

你经常在电影中看到人们在英国或美国庆祝白色圣诞节。但是澳大利亚的圣诞节就不一样了。

The holiday is on December 25. It comes at the hottest time of the year in Australia. The temperature is usually about 30℃ in most cities and can even be over 40℃. There is certainly no white Christmas in Australia!​

这个节日是在12月25日。这是澳大利亚一年中最热的时候。大多数城市的气温通常在30℃左右，甚至可能超过40℃。澳大利亚当然没有白色圣诞节!​

Because it is so hot, the tradition is to have a lunch outside and to swim in the pool or beach. Most people have a one-week holiday during this time. So they will travel to meet their family for Christmas lunch. ​Christmas lunch is usually a big meal of ham, turkey, salad and fresh seafood. Family members all cook something different to bring to the meal. Getting presents from "Santa Claus" always makes children very excited. They often play happily with the other family members. The sport of cricket （板球） is very popular in Australia and another tradition is to play a game of cricket in the garden. 

因为天气太热了，传统是在外面吃午饭，在游泳池或沙滩上游泳。大多数人在这段时间有一个星期的假期。所以他们会去和家人一起吃圣诞午餐。圣诞午餐通常是一顿大餐，有火腿、火鸡、沙拉和新鲜的海鲜。家庭成员都做一些不同的东西来吃饭。从“圣诞老人”那里得到礼物总是让孩子们非常兴奋。他们经常和其他家庭成员愉快地玩耍。板球运动在澳大利亚非常流行，另一个传统是在花园里打板球。

It is still a very exciting and fun time of the year in Australia, though there isn't a white Christmas. 

在澳大利亚，圣诞节仍然是一年中非常令人兴奋和有趣的时刻，尽管没有白色圣诞节。
