The Influence of Mrs.  Green
格林夫人的影响

Do you believe that we can have an important influence on anyone we meet?The right words at just the right time could change someone's life. 

你相信我们能对我们遇到的任何人产生重要影响吗?在恰当的时间说句恰当的话可以改变一个人的一生。

When I was 3 years old, my parents discovered I was deaf. After asking many doctors and parents of other deaf children, they decided not to put me in a special school. Although I seemed outgoing, my self-esteem was quite low. On my first day at school, the other kids made fun of me because of my hearing aid and the way I talked. I was hurt deeply and I saw myself as a(n) ugly kid. 

当我三岁的时候，我的父母发现我是聋子。在询问了许多医生和其他失聪儿童的父母后，他们决定不把我送到特殊学校。虽然我看起来很外向，但我的自尊心很低。在我上学的第一天，其他孩子取笑我的助听器和我说话的方式。我被深深地伤害了，我把自己看作一个丑陋的孩子。

Mrs.  Green, my teacher, changed all of that with a simple three-word phrase. One morning, she asked the class a question. Sitting at my desk silently, I read her lips and raised my hand right away. She called on me in front of the blackboard. I took a deep breath and nervously answered Mrs.  Green's question. 

我的老师格林夫人用一个简单的三个字的短语改变了这一切。一天早上，她问了全班一个问题。我静静地坐在桌旁，读了她的唇语，马上举起了手。她在黑板前叫我。我深吸了一口气，紧张地回答了格林夫人的问题。

I will never forget what happened next. Mrs.  Green pointed directly at me. With sparkling eyes and a big smile, she cried: "That's right, Ben!"

我永远不会忘记接下来发生的事。格林太太直接指着我。她的眼睛闪闪发光，脸上带着灿烂的笑容，大声说:“对了，本!”

For the first time in my young life, my confidence rose. At that moment, I decided that no matter how many difficulties I may face, I can overcome them. Thanks to those three simple words, my whole life changed from that moment. 

在我年轻的生命中，我的信心第一次上升了。那一刻，我下定决心，无论我面临多少困难，我都能克服它们。多亏了那三个简单的字，我的整个人生从此改变了。
