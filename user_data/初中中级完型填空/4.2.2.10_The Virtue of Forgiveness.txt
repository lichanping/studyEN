The Virtue of Forgiveness
宽恕的美德

When I was a twelve-year-old newspaper boy, an old lady who was my customer lived near my house. I have even forgotten her name. On a winter afternoon, I was playing with my friend near the old lady's backyard. I found a perfectly smooth rock and threw it out, but the stone hit a small window of her house. Unluckily, I saw the old lady standing behind the window. We knew we were in trouble, and ran away quickly. We were scared that we would be caught and didn't worry about the old lady with the broken window in winter. 

当我还是个12岁的报童时，一位老太太住在我家附近，她是我的顾客。我甚至忘了她的名字。一个冬天的下午，我和朋友在老太太的后院附近玩耍。我找到了一块非常光滑的石头，把它扔了出去，但那块石头击中了她家的一扇小窗户。不幸的是，我看见老妇人站在窗户后面。我们知道我们有麻烦了，赶紧跑开。我们害怕会被抓住，而不担心冬天窗户被打破的老太太。

The next morning, she was still greeting me with a smile when I gave her the newspaper. I made up my mind to save my money to correct my mistake. After three weeks, I had seven dollars. I put the money in an envelope with a note explaining everything and hoped that the seven dollars would cover the cost of repairing the window. 

第二天早上，当我把报纸递给她时，她仍然微笑着迎接我。我下定决心要存钱来改正我的错误。三个星期后，我有了7美元。我把钱装在一个信封里，并附上一张说明一切的纸条，希望这7美元能弥补修窗户的费用。

I waited until it was dark, and put the letter in her door. The next day, I handed the old lady her newspaper and she thanked me for it as usual and gave me a bag of cookies. After eating several cookies, I found an envelope and pulled it out. When I opened it, I was surprised. Inside were the seven dollars and a short note that said, "I'm proud of you. " I smiled in relief. However, I shall never forget the lesson about forgiveness she taught me. 

我一直等到天黑，才把信放进她的门里。第二天，我把报纸递给老太太，她像往常一样感谢我，并给了我一袋饼干。吃了几块饼干后，我发现了一个信封，并把它拿了出来。当我打开它时，我很惊讶。里面有7美元和一张纸条，上面写着:“我为你感到骄傲。”我如释重负地笑了。然而，我永远不会忘记她教给我的关于宽恕的教训。
