On the early morning of November 6th local time, Trump delivered a speech at his campaign headquarters in Florida. He said, "I want to thank the American people for giving me the extraordinary honor of being elected the 47th president and also the 45th president of the United States. Trump also said that he would help heal America and that he would fight for the American people every day and lead America into a golden age".

In June 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for the US presidency as a Republican. He was elected the 45th president of the United States in November 2016 and took the oath of office on January 20th, 2017. During his tenure, he pursued the "America First" policy and made great progress in tax cuts, tough trade policies, strengthening diplomatic and military layouts, and relaxing financial regulations through legislation, signing executive orders, and personnel appointments. He also announced the withdrawal from many international organizations.

In December 2020, Trump failed to be re-elected and lost to his opponent Biden. However, Trump refused to admit defeat, which eventually led to the Capitol riot. Trump was impeached by the US Congress twice in 2019 and 2021, becoming the first president in US history to be impeached twice.

2020年12月，特朗普未能连任，输给了对手拜登。然而，特朗普拒绝承认失败，最终引发了国会山暴乱事件。特朗普在 2019年和2021年两次遭到美国国会弹劾，成为美国历史上首位两次被弹劾的总统。
