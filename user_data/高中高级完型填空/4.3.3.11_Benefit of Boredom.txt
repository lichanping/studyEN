Benefit of Boredom
无聊的好处

Experts say boredom is good for kids. It forces them to be creative, improves their imaginations and helps them discover new things. A (n) case in point is 13-year-old Luke Thill from Dubuque, Iowa. 

专家说无聊对孩子有好处。它迫使他们发挥创造力，提高他们的想象力，帮助他们发现新事物。一个典型的例子是来自爱荷华州迪比克的13岁的卢克·蒂尔。

Luke was tired of playing video games and riding his bike, so he decided to build a tiny house in his backyard instead. He made money from cutting lawns(草坪)and even exchanged some services, such as gaining the help of an electrical engineer in exchange for sweeping his garage. Luke also used spare materials from his grandmother's house and other recycled materials from his neighbors for some of the windows and the door. 

卢克厌倦了玩电子游戏和骑自行车，所以他决定在后院建一个小房子。他通过修剪草坪赚钱(草坪)，甚至还提供了一些服务，比如打扫车库换取电气工程师的帮助。卢克还使用了他祖母家的备用材料和邻居的其他回收材料来做一些窗户和门。

The 5-square-foot home cost $1,500 to build and took 18 months. Inside there's a kitchenette, a back sitting room, a table and a mounted(镶嵌的)TV, and an upstairs bedroom can be easily accessed by stairway. 

这座5平方英尺的房子耗资1500美元，耗时18个月。里面有一个小厨房，后面的起居室，一张桌子和一台安装的(镶嵌的)电视，楼上的卧室可以很容易地通过楼梯进入。

Although Luke did the research and learned how to do all the work, he had his father's help throughout the project. Greg Thill was very happy that his son learned to stay on budget and deal with grown-ups. However, he had some simple rules when Luke started the house: "You raise the money.  You build it.  And you own it. "

虽然卢克做了研究并学会了如何做所有的工作，但他在整个项目中都得到了父亲的帮助。格雷格·蒂尔(Greg Thill)很高兴他的儿子学会了不超支并与大人打交道。然而，当卢克开始创业时，他有一些简单的规则:“你筹集资金。你建造它。你拥有它。”

Luke is now in love with buildings. ​He has a YouTube channel and hopes to inspire other kids to start building. Eventually, he wants to build a bigger tiny house to live in, but for now, he hangs out in his new home a few nights a week, does homework there, and uses it to take a break from his twin brother. 

卢克现在爱上了建筑。他在YouTube上有一个频道，希望能激励其他孩子开始建造。最终，他想建一个更大的小房子住，但现在，他每周有几个晚上会去他的新家，在那里做作业，并利用它来与他的双胞胎兄弟休息一下。
