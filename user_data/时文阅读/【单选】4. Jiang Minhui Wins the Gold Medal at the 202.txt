【单选】4. 江旻憓在 2024 年巴黎奥运会上斩获金牌

On July 27th local time, in the gold medal match of the women's individual epee at the Paris Olympics, facing the host French player, the top seed Jiang Minhui trailed 0-4 in the first round and even faced a huge disadvantage of 1-7 in the second round. After calmly analyzing the situation, she requested to change swords, and this move became the key to the reversal of the event. After changing swords, she gradually found her touch and lured the opponent into making mistakes. In the end, with one decisive strike, she completed a super comeback with a score of 13-12.

当地时间 7 月 27 日，在巴黎奥运会女子个人重剑赛的金牌争夺战中，面对东道主法国选手，头号种子江旻憓在首轮以 0 - 4 落后，第二轮甚至一度以 1 - 7 处于巨大劣势。在冷静分析形势后，她请求换剑，这一举动成为了比赛逆转的关键。换剑之后，她逐渐找回手感，并诱使对手犯错。最终，她一剑封喉，以 13 - 12 的比分完成了超级大逆转。

This is the 30-year-old Jiang Minhui's third appearance in the Olympics. The 2016 Rio Olympics was her first time on the Olympic stage. Although she stopped at the top 16, she still made history by achieving the first Olympic victory for Hong Kong fencing. Later, she suffered from injuries to her left and right knees within two years, with ligament ruptures, but she quickly completed her rehabilitation and returned to the field, once reaching the top of the world rankings. At the Tokyo Olympics, she stopped at the quarterfinals.

这是 30 岁的江旻憓第三次参加奥运会。2016 年里约奥运会是她首次登上奥运舞台。尽管她止步于 16 强，但她仍创造了历史，为中国香港击剑队取得了奥运首胜。后来，她在两年内左右膝盖受伤，韧带断裂，但她迅速完成康复并重返赛场，一度登上世界排名榜首。在东京奥运会上，她止步于四分之一决赛。

Jiang Minhui's championship has brought the first gold medal and the first medal to the Hong Kong, China team in this Olympic Games. This gold medal is the second Olympic gold medal in the history of the Hong Kong, China fencing team, and fencing has also become the first event in Hong Kong's history to have Olympic gold medals in two consecutive games.

江旻憓的夺冠为中国香港队在本届奥运会上带来了首枚金牌和首枚奖牌。这枚金牌是中国香港击剑队历史上的第二枚奥运金牌，击剑也成为了香港历史上首个连续两届奥运会都斩获金牌的项目。

After Jiang Minhui won the championship, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Li Jiachao, extended his heartfelt congratulations to her and her coach, stating that she demonstrated an excellent level in the competition, with sharp fencing skills and fully showing a tenacious fighting spirit. Winning the gold medal is truly well-deserved and exciting. She has once again created history for Hong Kong's fencing sport and also proven the extraordinary strength of Hong Kong athletes, making all Hong Kong citizens proud.

江旻憓夺冠后，香港特别行政区行政长官李家超向她及其教练致以衷心祝贺，称她在比赛中展现出了高超水平，剑术精湛，充分展现了顽强的拼搏精神。夺得金牌实至名归，令人振奋。她再次为香港击剑运动创造了历史，也证明了香港运动员的非凡实力，令全体香港市民感到骄傲。

Jiang Minhui has also not slackened in her studies. She is a doctoral student in law at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and has obtained a bachelor's degree in international politics from Stanford University and a master's degree in law from Renmin University of China. Her enlightenment coach Chen Weijin commented that she has been smart since childhood and has an extraordinary ability to accept things. In the final of this Paris Olympics, she withstood the pressure and won by reversing the situation, perfectly embodying the sports spirit.

江旻憓在学业上也没有松懈。她是香港中文大学的法学博士生，并拥有斯坦福大学国际政治学士学位和中国人民大学法学硕士学位。她的启蒙教练陈伟劲评价说，她从小就聪明，接受事物的能力非凡。在本次巴黎奥运会的决赛中，她顶住压力，逆转取胜，完美地体现了体育精神。
