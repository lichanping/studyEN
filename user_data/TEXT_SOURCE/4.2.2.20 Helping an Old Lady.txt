4.2.2.20 Helping an Old Lady
帮助一位老太太

I do volunteer work every Friday.A week ago, I had the pleasure of helping one sick lady.

我每周五都做志愿者工作。一周前，我很荣幸地帮助了一位生病的女士。

She is in her eighties and is very weak and I always bring her lunch on Fridays.She looked worried when she opened the door that day.She told me her phone was broken and that she couldn't receive the call from her doctor.She went to her neighbors, but they were not at home.She thought maybe the mailman could help her, but he didn't come.She was disappointed.

她八十多岁了，身体很虚弱，我总是在星期五给她送午饭。那天，当她打开门的时候，她看起来很焦虑。她告诉我她的手机坏了，她收不到医生的电话。她去找邻居，但他们都不在家。她想也许邮递员可以帮助她，但是他没有来。她很失望。

Having heard her story, I decided to do something for her.I tried to satisfy the needs of the old woman who only needed a helping hand.I called the phone company (公司) and made sure they knew that getting this phone fixed was important.I took down her phone number and her name just to make sure I could call her later to make sure that the phone had been fixed.

听了她的故事，我决定为她做点什么。我尽力满足那位只需要援助之手的老妇人的需要。我给电话公司打了电话，确保他们知道修理这部电话很重要。我记下了她的电话号码和名字，这样我就可以稍后打电话给她，确保电话已经修好了。

I called the phone company twice that day.They told me they had checked the phone and got the phone fixed.I called the old woman.She was so thankful that she was in tears.To make sure she was fine, I called her every day after that.

那天我给电话公司打了两次电话。他们告诉我，他们已经检查过电话，把电话修好了。我打电话给老妇人。她感激得流下了眼泪。为了确保她没事，从那以后我每天都给她打电话。

Just being able to help her in her time of difficulty filled my heart with such love and happiness.It is not so hard to help someone like a neighbor.Sometimes, all that is needed is just a smile, a hug or a phone call.

能在她困难的时候帮助她，我的心就充满了爱和幸福。帮助像邻居这样的人并不难。有时候，我们所需要的只是一个微笑，一个拥抱或一个电话。
