城市社区食堂吸引了越来越多的年轻人。“这真的很有帮助，节省了很多时间，”35岁的杨晨说。“价格实惠，工作人员也很友善，” 杨晨回忆起自己在云林食堂的初次体验时说道。“买一份荤菜、一份素菜和一碗米饭总共只花了我 13 元。很便宜，而且饭菜很好吃。”李恒是云林餐厅的另一位年轻食客。李恒抱着孩子说，他和家人多次来食堂吃早餐“在这里吃早餐很方便，因为离我们家近，而且价格不贵。”许多年轻人在网上分享他们在社区食堂的用餐体验。在一些帖子下，其他用户表达对菜品的喜爱，并询问食堂在哪里，或者他们所在的社区是否有类似的食堂。社区食堂通常是为了帮助社区里的老年人而设立的。“年轻人工作繁忙，做饭和打扫厨房的时间较少。而且外卖食品不健康，还得等很长时间，” 研究员周吉霞说。社区食堂不仅填饱了年轻人的肚子，还帮他们摆脱了打扫厨房的负担。所以他们被越来越多的年轻人喜爱。
