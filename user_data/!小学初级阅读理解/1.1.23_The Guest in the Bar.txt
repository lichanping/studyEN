The Guest in the Bar
酒吧里的客人

Daniel and his wife, Linda had a small bar（酒吧）at the airport. The bar often kept open till after midnight, because people wanted to drink there when they were waiting for planes. 

丹尼尔和他的妻子琳达在机场开了一家小酒吧。这家酒吧经常开到午夜以后，因为人们在等飞机的时候想在那里喝酒。

At two o’clock one morning, one old man was still at the table in the bar. He was asleep. Linda was tired and sleepy. She wanted to go to bed. She looked into the bar several times（几次）, and each time the old man was still there. Then at last she went to her husband and said to him, “You’ve woken that man six times now, Daniel, but he isn’t drinking anything.  Why don’t you send him away? It’s very late. ”“Oh, no, I don’t want to send him away,” answered her husband with a smile.  “You see, whenever（无论什么时候）I wake him up, he asks for his bill（账单）, and when I bring it to him, he pays it.  Then he goes to sleep again. ”

一天凌晨两点钟，一位老人还坐在酒吧间的桌旁。他睡着了。琳达又累又困。她想睡觉了。她往酒吧里看了好几次，每次老人都还在那里。最后她走到丈夫跟前，对他说:“你已经叫醒那人六次了，可他什么也没喝。你为什么不把他打发走?很晚了。”“哦，不，我不想送他走，”她丈夫笑着回答。“你看，每次我叫醒他，他都要帐单，我拿来给他，他就付了。然后他又睡着了。”
