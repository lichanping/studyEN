Hello! My name is Helen. I'm a student of Class Six, Grade Five. Our school is very big and it's very beautiful. And our playground is very big, too. We often play games on the playground after class. Look, some boys are playing football over there. Some girls are playing volleyball. What are the teachers doing there?Oh, they are playing basketball!Playing ball games is very good for us. Let's do more exercise from now on. Come on, boys and girls!
