Dreams and Sleep
做梦和睡眠

Dreams may be more important than sleep. “Some people don't need much sleep.  But we all need to dream. ” scientists say. Dreams take up about one quarter of our sleeping time. People have several dreams each night. Dreams are like short films. They are usually in color. Some dreams are like old films. They come to us over and over again. That may be because the dreamer is worrying about something, which may be a way of trying to find an answer. Some people get new ideas about their work from dreams. They could have been thinking about their work all day. These thoughts can carry over into dreams. Sometimes we wake up with a good feeling from a dream. But often we can't remember the dream. Dreams can disappear quickly from memory. Too much dreaming can be harmful. The more we sleep, the longer we dream. The mind is hard at work when we dream. That is why we may have a long sleep and still wake up tiredly. 

梦可能比睡眠更重要。“有些人不需要太多睡眠。但我们都需要做梦。科学家说。梦占据了我们睡眠时间的四分之一。人们每晚都会做好几个梦。梦就像短片。它们通常是彩色的。有些梦就像老电影。他们一次又一次地来找我们。这可能是因为梦者正在担心一些他们努力想要找到答案的事情。有些人从梦中获得关于工作的新想法。他们可能整天都在想着自己的工作。这些想法可以延续到梦中。有时我们从梦中醒来，感觉很好。但我们常常记不住梦。梦可以很快从记忆中消失。做太多的梦是有害的。我们睡得越多，做梦的时间就越长。当我们做梦时，大脑在努力工作。这就是为什么我们可能睡了很长时间，醒来仍然很累。
