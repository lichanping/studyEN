My Sunday
我的星期天

I am a schoolboy. I have lessons from Monday to Friday. On Sunday morning, I usually get up very late. I wash my face and then go out to do morning exercises. It is about nine o'clock. After I eat my breakfast. I often go to the park with my parents. The park is not far from our home, so we go there by bike. It takes us about ten minutes to get there by bike. There are many people in the park. They are men and women, old and young. Parents must look after their children. There is a big lake in the middle of the park. Some children are swimming. Some are boating with their parents. I like boating very much. I want to boat, too. My parents buy three tickets. We have a good time there. How happy we are!

我是一个小学生。我从星期一到星期五都有课。星期天早上，我通常起得很晚。我洗脸，然后出去做早操。现在大约是9点钟。等我吃完早餐。我经常和我的父母去公园。公园离我们家不远，所以我们骑自行车去那里。我们骑自行车到那里大约需要十分钟。公园里有很多人。他们有男有女，有老有少。父母必须照顾他们的孩子。公园的中央有一个大湖。一些孩子在游泳。有些人正在和他们的父母划船。我非常喜欢划船。我也想划船。我的父母买了三张票。我们在那里玩得很开心。我们是多么幸福啊!
