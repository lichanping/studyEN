Pull up Trees
拔树

A boy wanted to give up his bad habits, so he asked a clever old man for help. The old man took the boy for a walk through a garden. He stopped suddenly and asked the boy to pull up（拔） a small plant. The boy pulled it up easily. The old man then asked him to pull up a big plant. The boy pulled hard, and the plant came out. 

一个男孩想改掉他的坏习惯，所以他向一位聪明的老人寻求帮助。老人带着男孩穿过花园散步。他突然停下来，让男孩拔起一株小植物。男孩轻而易举地把它拔了起来。然后老人让他拔掉一棵大植物。男孩使劲拔，植物长出来了。

Now pull up that one, said the old man, pointing to a bush（灌木）. The boy did his best, and finally pulled it up. 

“现在把那根拔起来，”老人指着一丛灌木说。男孩尽了最大的努力，终于把它拔了起来。

Now take out this one, said the old man, pointing to a tree. The boy put his arms around the tree and tried to pull it up. But he couldn't do it. 

现在把这个拿出来，老人指着一棵树说。男孩用双臂搂住树，想把它拔起来。但他做不到。

It's the same with bad habits, said the old man.  "When they're young, it's easy to pull them up, but when they grow up, it's difficult to uproot （根除）. "

坏习惯也是一样，老人说。“当他们小的时候，拔他们很容易，但当他们长大了，拔他们就很难了。”
