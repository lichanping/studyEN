丽莎姨妈病了。她在人民医院。杰克的妈妈叫他带一篮子鸡蛋给丽莎姨妈。但是杰克不认识路。

On the way, Jack saw an old man. The old man walked in front of him. He went up and said, "Hi, old fellow. . . "But the old man didn't answer him and walked on. Jack got puzzled（迷惑的）. Suddenly he understood why. It was not polite（有礼貌的） to say "old fellow" to an old man. Now he went up to the old man again and asked, "Excuse me, Grandpa, would you please tell me the way to the People's Hospital?"This time the old man answered, "Well, go along this street, then turn left.  It is just behind the post office. "

在路上，杰克看到一位老人。老人走在他前面。他走上前说:“嗨，老伙计……”但是老人没有回答他，继续往前走。杰克很困惑。突然，他明白了为什么。对一位老人说“老伙计”是不礼貌的。现在他又走到老人面前问道:“对不起，爷爷，您能告诉我去人民医院的路吗?”这次老人回答说:“嗯，沿着这条街走，然后向左拐。就在邮局后面。”

Jack thanked the old man and walked on. Soon he found the hospital. 

杰克谢过老人，继续往前走。很快他就找到了医院。
