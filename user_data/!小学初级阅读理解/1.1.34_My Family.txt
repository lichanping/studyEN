My Family
我的一家

In my family, there are my parents, my grandparents, my brother and I. We are a happy family. My father is a teacher. He works in a school. He gets up early and works very hard every day. Sometimes he helps me with my homework. His students love him very much because he likes to help them. My mother is a writer. She doesn't need to go to work but she writes books, cleans （打扫） the house and takes care of （照顾） us. My grandparents are old. They don't have jobs. They stay at home every day, reading newspapers （读报） and watching TV. They go to bed early. My brother is a student. He is in my school, too. He likes playing basketball, tennis and ping-pong. I like to play soccer, ping-pong and computer games. After school, we get home early. We do our homework, play sports and help our parents in the evening. 

在我的家庭，有我的父母，我的祖父母，我的兄弟和我。我们是一个幸福的家庭。我的父亲是一名教师。他在一所学校工作。他起得很早，每天都很努力地工作。有时他帮我做作业。他的学生很喜欢他，因为他喜欢帮助他们。我妈妈是一位作家。她不需要去上班，但她写书，打扫房子，照顾我们。我的祖父母老了。他们没有工作。他们每天呆在家里，读报纸和看电视。他们早早上床睡觉。我哥哥是一名学生。他也在我的学校。他喜欢打篮球、网球和乒乓球。我喜欢踢足球，乒乓球和电脑游戏。放学后，我们很早就回家了。晚上我们做作业，做运动，帮助父母。
