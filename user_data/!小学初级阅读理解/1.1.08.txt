My name is Jim. There are many rules in my home. I must get up before 7:00. Because I mustn't be late for class. I must make the bed every morning. I mustn't watch TV or play computer games on school nights. But on weekends (周末) I can watch movies and cartoons. That is my fun time. I must clean my room once a week( 一周一次). Oh, if you come to my house, you can't wear shoes or sit on my bed. Do you want to come to my house?

我叫吉姆。我家有很多规矩。我必须在7点前起床。因为我上课不能迟到。我必须每天早上整理床铺。我不能在上学的晚上看电视或玩电脑游戏。但是在周末我可以看电影和动画片。那是我的快乐时光。我必须每周打扫一次我的房间。哦，如果你来我家，你不能穿鞋，也不能坐在我的床上。你想去我家吗?
