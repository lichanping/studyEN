My father is a doctor. He works in the No. 1 Hospital. He is very busy. He is friendly to his patients(病人). My mother works in the hospital too. She is a nurse. She often helps doctors in her work. They work hard. When they come back from their work, they look very tired. I want to help them. So I often do some housework. I want to be a doctor like my father in the future. And I want to help sick people like him.
