Three Gifts
三件礼物

An old woman lived in the country. She had three sons. They were Kim, Mike and John. They left home to make money and became rich soon. This year they came back together on Mother's Day. Each of them had a gift for their mother. 

一位老妇人住在乡下。她有三个儿子。他们是金、迈克和约翰。他们离家去赚钱，很快就发财了。今年的母亲节，他们又团聚了。他们每个人都给母亲准备了一份礼物。

Kim bought a big and beautiful house for mum. Mike sent her a car. John's gift was a parrot that could speak to mum. 

金给妈妈买了一所又大又漂亮的房子。迈克给她送了一辆车。约翰的礼物是一只能和妈妈说话的鹦鹉。

Several days later, mum sent them letters of thanks: "Kim," she wrote to one son, "the house you bought is so large.  I live in one room, but I have to clean the whole house. "

几天后，妈妈给他们寄来了感谢信:“金，”她给一个儿子写道，“你买的房子太大了。我住在一个房间里，但我必须打扫整个房子。”

"Mike", she wrote to another,"I am too old to travel.  I spend most of the time at home, so I don't use the car. "

“迈克，”她给另一个人写道，“我太老了，不能旅行了。我大部分时间都呆在家里，所以我不用车。”

"Dearest John," she wrote to her third son,"you really know what I like. The chick was delicious.  Thanks. "

“最亲爱的约翰，”她写信给她的第三个儿子，“你真的知道我喜欢什么。这只小鸡很好吃。谢谢。”
