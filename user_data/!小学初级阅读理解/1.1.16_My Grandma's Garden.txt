My Grandma's Garden
我祖母的花园

My grandma is over sixty, but she still likes gardening very much. When she is busy with her work in the garden, there is always a smile on her face. 

我奶奶已经六十多岁了，但她仍然非常喜欢园艺。当她在花园里忙着她的工作时，她脸上总是带着微笑。

She grows all sorts of plants in her garden. She works very hard and looks after them every day. So all the plants in her garden grow well. When you come to visit her garden, you can find beautiful flowers there. 

她在花园里种了各种各样的植物。她工作很努力，每天都照顾他们。所以她花园里所有的植物都长得很好。当你来参观她的花园时，你可以在那里发现美丽的花朵。

My grandmother not only waters the flowers, grass and trees but also lets them listen to some music. She says music helps them grow well. Maybe that's true. She's really a clever lady. On weekends my parents and I visit her and help her take care of the garden. When we leave, she always gives us some flowers. I love my grandma and her pretty garden. 

我的祖母不仅给花、草和树浇水，还让它们听一些音乐。她说，音乐有助于他们茁壮成长。也许这是真的。她真是个聪明的女人。在周末，我的父母和我去看望她，并帮助她照顾花园。当我们离开时，她总是给我们一些花。我爱我的奶奶和她漂亮的花园。
