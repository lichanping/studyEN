Swimming is healthy for us. It is cool to swim when the weather is hot. Many people think swimming is very easy to learn. But it isn't. I want to quit before because it is so difficult. At last, I learn to swim and I enjoy it now. 

游泳对我们有益健康。天气热的时候游泳是凉爽的。许多人认为游泳很容易学。但事实并非如此。我想提前退出，因为它太难了。最后，我学会了游泳，我现在很享受它。

每天游泳是个好习惯。我现在就这么做。我想有一天成为第二个孙杨。
