Swimming is healthy for us. It is cool to swim when the weather is hot. Many people think swimming is very easy to learn. But it isn't. I want to quit before because it is so difficult. At last, I learn to swim and I enjoy it now. 

游泳对我们有益健康。天气热的时候游泳是凉爽的。许多人认为游泳很容易学。但事实并非如此。我想提前退出，因为它太难了。最后，我学会了游泳，我现在很享受它。

It is a good habit to swim every day. And I do it now. I want to be the second Sun Yang one day.

主旨大意：游泳不仅可以锻炼身体，还可以帮助我们放松。我开始学习游泳了，但是我有点怕水。我的游泳教练特别好，在他的教导下，我不怕水了。我开始每天都游泳，我享受游泳，我想成为第二个孙杨。



长难句：
1. It is cool to swim when the weather is hot中，在这句话中，主句是It is cool to swim，when引导了一个时间状语从句，表示当…时候。



重点语言点：
not only … but also 不仅…而且
get moving行动起来
be good for 有益于，对…有好处
be afraid to do sth. 害怕做某事

be afraid of害怕

at last最后
be healthy for 对…有益
