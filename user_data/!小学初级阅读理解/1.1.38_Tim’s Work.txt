Tim’s Work
蒂姆的工作

Tim works in a small shop. It is near a factory. Every day many workers, old ladies, and housewives come to buy things. He lives not very far from the shop. He usually gets up at six, has breakfast, and then goes to work by bike. He takes some food along in his lunch box. He gets to the shop at about ten to seven. At seven, customers begin to come in. They buy meat, eggs, oil, salt, biscuits, and many other things. This shop doesn't sell vegetables or fruit. There is another shop for those things. Tim has his meal at noon from his lunch box. The shop is closed at seven in the evening. Tim closes the door after some cleaning in the shop. He goes home for supper and has a good rest like watching TV or doing some reading. Some people may think Tim's work is not interesting. But he really enjoys it because he can meet different people though he's really busy every day.
