The Importance of Plants
植物的重要性

Plants are very important. This is because plants can make food from air, water, and sunlight. Animals and man cannot make food from air, water, and sunlight. Animals can get their food by eating plants and other animals. Man gets food by eating plants and animals, too. So animals and man need plants to live. This is why there are so many plants around us. 

植物非常重要。这是因为植物可以从空气、水和阳光中制造食物。动物和人类不能从空气、水和阳光中制造食物。动物可以通过吃植物和其他动物来获取食物。人类也通过吃植物和动物来获取食物。所以动物和人类都需要植物来生存。这就是为什么我们周围有这么多植物的原因。

There are two kinds of plants: flowering plants and non-flowering （无花的）plants. Almost all the trees around us are flowering plants. You can know some trees from their flowers and fruit. Non-flowering plants do not grow flowers. You cannot see many non-flowering plants around you. 

有两种植物:开花植物和不开花植物。我们周围几乎所有的树都是开花植物。你可以从它们的花和果实中认识一些树。不开花的植物不开花。在你周围你看不到很多不开花的植物。

If we look carefully at the plants around us, we will find that there are many kinds of plants. Some plants are big and some are small. Most of them are green. We can live on the Earth because of the plants around us. 

如果我们仔细观察我们周围的植物，我们会发现植物的种类很多。有些植物很大，有些很小。它们大多是绿色的。我们可以生活在地球上，因为我们周围的植物。
