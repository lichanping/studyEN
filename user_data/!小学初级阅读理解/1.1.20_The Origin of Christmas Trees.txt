The Origin of Christmas Trees
圣诞树的由来

It wouldn’t be Christmas without a beautiful tree. 

没有美丽的圣诞树就不是圣诞节了。

Days before the holiday season, Western children begin decorating (装饰) Christmas trees. They put colourful lights and stars on them. But the best things are the gifts (礼物) under the tree!Where did the first Christmas tree come from?There are many stories about it. 

在节日来临的前几天，西方的孩子们开始装饰圣诞树。他们把五颜六色的灯和星星放在上面。但是最好的东西是树下的礼物!第一棵圣诞树是从哪里来的?关于它有很多故事。

One is about the German Martin Luther. He was walking through the forest (树林) on Christmas Eve. As he walked, he saw millions of stars above the ever-green (常绿的) trees. He thought it was beautiful. He cut down a small tree and took it home. He put candles (蜡烛) on it. 

一个是关于德国人马丁·路德的。一个平安夜，他正走过森林。当他走着的时候，他看到在常青树的上方有数百万颗星星。他觉得很美。他砍倒了一棵小树，把它带回家。他把蜡烛放在上面。

Another story is about a poor woodman. He met a lost and hungry child on Christmas Eve. He was very poor himself, but gave the child food and a place to stay. He woke up the next morning to find a beautiful tree outside his door. The hungry child was in fact an angel (天使). He wanted to thank the woodman. 

另一个故事是关于一个贫穷的樵夫的。他在平安夜遇到了一个迷路又饥饿的孩子。他自己也很穷，但还是给了孩子吃的和住的地方。第二天早上醒来，他发现门外有一棵美丽的树。那个饥饿的孩子实际上是一个天使。他想感谢樵夫。

People first had Christmas trees in Germany in 1600s. Now there are different kinds of Christmas trees, even man-made ones. But they all have a very big star or an angel on the top. 

17世纪的德国，人们首先有了圣诞树。现在有各种各样的圣诞树，甚至还有人造的。但他们都有一个非常大的星星或天使在顶部。
