Christmas Day
圣诞节

Every year there is a very big Christmas tree in the center of London. This is the present from the people of Norway to the people of Great Britain. They send it to the Londoners every year and Londoners decorate the Christmas tree. In the evening before Christmas, people like to look at the big tree. On Christmas Eve the streets in London are decorated, too. The shops are very busy at Christmas. People want to buy presents for their family and friends. People open their presents on Christmas morning and they are all happy with what they get. For Christmas lunch, people eat turkey, potatoes, and green vegetables. Then they have the Christmas pudding. At five o'clock it's time for tea and Christmas cake. On Christmas Day people wish their nearest and dearest friends a merry Christmas. 

每年在伦敦市中心都有一棵很大的圣诞树。这是挪威人民送给大不列颠人民的礼物。他们每年都把它送给伦敦人，伦敦人装饰圣诞树。在圣诞节前的晚上，人们喜欢看那棵大树。在平安夜，伦敦的街道也被装饰起来。圣诞节时商店很忙。人们想给家人和朋友买礼物。人们在圣诞节的早晨打开他们的礼物，他们都很高兴他们得到了什么。圣诞节午餐，人们吃火鸡、土豆和绿色蔬菜。然后他们吃圣诞布丁。五点钟是喝茶和吃圣诞蛋糕的时间。在圣诞节那天，人们祝他们最亲密的朋友圣诞快乐。
