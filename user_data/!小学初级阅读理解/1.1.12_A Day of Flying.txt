A Day of "Flying"
“飞翔”的一天

This Sunday, Betty plays with Richard and Helen. They play volleyball and climb trees in the park. “This is boring.  Let's have fun,” says Helen. They go to her house. Helen opens a big red umbrella and stands on a chair. Then she jumps off. “Look! I can fly!” she says. “That chair isn't very high,” said Richard. “Watch me!” He takes the umbrella and jumps off a table. 

这个星期天，贝蒂和理查德、海伦一起玩。他们在公园里打排球和爬树。“这太无聊了。让我们玩得开心点，”海伦说。他们去了她家。海伦打开一把红色的大伞，站在椅子上。然后她跳了下去。“看!我能飞!她说。“那把椅子不是很高，”理查德说。“看我的!”他拿起雨伞，从桌子上跳了下去。

Betty wants to fly too. She wants to jump off the balcony (阳台). “No! It's too high!” shouts Richard. “It isn't very high,” says Betty. Betty can see the soft grass on the ground. She is very afraid, but she opens the umbrella and jumps. She falls into (跌入) some flowers. 

贝蒂也想飞。她想从阳台跳下去。“不!太高了!理查德喊道。“它不是很高，”贝蒂说。贝蒂可以看到地上柔软的草。她很害怕，但她还是打开伞跳了起来。她落入了花丛中。

Betty hurts her legs. She goes to see the doctor. The doctor says, “Your legs are OK, Betty.  But don't try to fly again!”The next day, the children in her class give her a funny card. Inside it says, “Go by plane next time, Betty!”

贝蒂伤了她的腿。她去看医生。医生说:“贝蒂，你的腿没事。但别再试着飞了!”第二天，她班上的孩子们给了她一张有趣的卡片。里面写着:“贝蒂，下次坐飞机吧!”
