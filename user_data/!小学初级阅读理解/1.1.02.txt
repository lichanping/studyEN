Hello! My name is Mary. I'm eleven years old. I'm in Class One, Grade Five. Welcome to our school!Look! This is our library. We borrow books from the library. We read storybooks there. In the library, we must be quiet. We shouldn't drink or eat in it. Here is our language lab. We usually have English lessons from Monday to Thursday. Now It's time for class. The teacher is telling a story about the Tiger King. He is the king of all the animals. He doesn't obey any rules. All the other animals must do the housework for him. Mr Elephant must clean the house. Miss Mouse must cook food for him. Miss Rabbit must wash his clothes.  The students are listening to the teacher carefully. There is a music room, an art room in our school. We can do many interesting things there. Our school is big and nice. I like it very much. 

你好!我叫玛丽。我十一岁了。我在五年级一班。欢迎来到我们学校!看！这是我们的图书馆。我们从图书馆借书。我们在那里读故事书。在图书馆，我们必须保持安静。我们不应该在里面吃喝。这是我们的语言实验室。我们通常从星期一到星期四上英语课。现在该上课了。老师正在讲一个关于虎王的故事。他是所有动物的国王。他不遵守任何规则。所有其他的动物都必须为他做家务。大象先生必须打扫房子。老鼠小姐必须为他做饭。兔子小姐必须洗他的衣服……学生们正在认真地听老师讲课。我们学校有一间音乐室，一间美术室。我们可以在那里做很多有趣的事情。我们的学校又大又漂亮。我非常喜欢它。
