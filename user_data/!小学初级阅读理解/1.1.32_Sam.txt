山姆

Sam is my cousin. He is only four years old. He likes to touch everything. One day, Sam and I are walking in the park. Suddenly, Sam sees some bees on the flowers. He is very happy. He walks on the grass and catches them. Then a park keeper comes to us. He points to a sign on the grass and says, "Can't you see the sign ?"Sam says, "What does it mean?"It means you shouldn't walk on the grass.  Fine ten yuan . Oh, sorry, sir.  I don't know the sign, I just have five yuan .  I put only one foot on the grass. The park keeper laughs and says, "OK, I won't fine you.  Remember don't do it again. "

山姆是我的表弟。他只有四岁。他喜欢摸任何东西。一天，山姆和我在公园里散步。突然，山姆看到花上有一些蜜蜂。他很高兴。他走在草地上抓住了它们。然后一个公园管理员向我们走来。他指着草地上的一个标志说:“你看不见这个标志吗?”山姆说:“这是什么意思?”它的意思是你不应该在草地上走。罚款十元。哦，对不起，先生。我不知道牌子，我只有5元钱。我只把一只脚放在草地上。公园管理员笑着说:“好吧，我不会罚你的。记住别再这样了。”
