Nature Zoo
动物园

When my mother and I are free, she always takes me out to relax. Today is Children's Day. I go to the Nature Zoo with my mother. The weather（天气） is fine. There are many people there, and everyone is happy. 

当我和妈妈有空的时候，她总是带我出去放松。今天是儿童节。我和妈妈一起去自然动物园。天气很好。那里有很多人，每个人都很高兴。

I see many animals in the zoo, like elephants, tigers, lions, giraffes, and monkeys. My mother and I like elephants very much because they are very friendly. We give them some bananas to eat, and they like them. The giraffes are very tall, and they are a little bit quiet. The lions and the tigers are kind of scary, but they are beautiful. I think the monkeys are cute and clever. People always give them some fruit to eat. They are very happy. I like them best. 

我在动物园里看到许多动物，像大象、老虎、狮子、长颈鹿和猴子。我妈妈和我都非常喜欢大象，因为它们非常友好。我们给他们一些香蕉吃，他们喜欢吃。长颈鹿很高，它们有点安静。狮子和老虎有点吓人，但它们很漂亮。我认为猴子是可爱和聪明的。人们总是给他们一些水果吃。他们很高兴。我最喜欢他们。

In fact, all the animals are our friends. We must love and protect（保护） them. 

事实上，所有的动物都是我们的朋友。我们必须爱护和保护他们。
