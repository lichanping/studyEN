Spring Festival
春节

Spring Festival is our Chinese people's festival. There are twelve names. We call it the year of sheep, the year of dog… and the year of monkey. Before the day of the festival, people are very busy（忙于 ） shopping and cleaning their houses. On the Eve, there is a big family dinner. After dinner, all the family stay up late（ 守夜 ） to welcome the new year. It is the middle of the night. We have some dumplings and watch many good TV programs（ 节目）. On the first day of the New Year, people wear their new clothes to go to their friends' houses. They say "Happy Spring Festival" to each other. Children will get some money from their parents or other people. So people especially（ 特别） children like Spring Festival very much. 

春节是我们中国人的节日。有十二个名字。我们称它为羊年、狗年和猴年。在春节之前，人们都忙着购物和打扫房子。在除夕，有一个大的家庭晚餐。晚饭后，全家人都熬夜迎接新年。现在是半夜。我们吃饺子，看很多好看的电视节目。在新年的第一天，人们穿着新衣服去朋友家。他们互相说“春节快乐”。孩子们会从父母或其他人那里得到一些钱。所以人们，尤其是孩子们非常喜欢春节。
