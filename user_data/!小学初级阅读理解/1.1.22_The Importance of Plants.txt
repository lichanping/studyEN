The Importance of Plants
植被的重要性

It is March 12th. It’s Tree Planting Day. There are many people on the hills. They’re planting trees. People plant many trees today. Plants are important to us. They can make food from the air, water and sunlight. But animals and people can’t do so. Animals and people can get food from plants. Without plants, life will not go on. Plants make the air clean. They can keep water from flowing away（流失）. They can stop wind from blowing up sand and earth. 

今天是三月十二日。今天是植树节。山上有很多人。他们正在植树。今天人们种了许多树。植物对我们很重要。它们可以从空气、水和阳光中制造食物。但是动物和人不能这样做。动物和人可以从植物中获取食物。没有植物，生命就无法继续。植物使空气清洁。它们能防止水流失。它们可以阻止风吹起沙子和泥土。

But in some places people are cutting down too many trees. This brings about floods and sandstorm. Now more and more people know that plants are important. They will plant more trees and grow more plants. They will try to protect the trees. 

但是在一些地方，人们砍伐了太多的树木。这就带来了洪水和沙尘暴。现在越来越多的人知道植物是重要的。他们将种更多的树，种植更多的植物。他们会尽力保护树木。
