We have twenty minutes’ rest between classes. Look! Most of us are playing during the rest time. Some students are on the playground. They are having a basketball game. Oh! A boy is running with a ball. And another is trying to stop him. They are so cool. And there are some girls watching the game. Some students are in the classroom. They are talking. A few of them are reading or doing homework. Look! A girl is looking at the birds in a tree in front of the classroom. She must be thinking of something interesting because she is smiling. What are the teachers doing?Do you know?Some of them are working in the office, and some are talking with students. Everyone is busy with his or her things. Busy and happy!

课间我们有20分钟的休息时间。看！我们大多数人都在休息时间玩。一些学生在操场上。他们正在进行一场篮球赛。哦!一个男孩带着球在跑。还有一个人在试图阻止他。他们太酷了。有一些女孩在看比赛。一些学生在教室里。他们在谈话。他们中有几个人在看书或做作业。看！一个女孩正在看教室前面树上的鸟。她一定在想什么有趣的事情，因为她在笑。老师们在做什么?你知道吗?他们中的一些人在办公室工作，一些人在和学生交谈。每个人都忙着他或她的事情。忙碌而快乐!
