The Rabbit and the Wolf
兔子和狼

One day, a rabbit is walking near the river. A wolf (狼) is crying, “Help! Help!” A big stone (石头) is on the wolf's back. “Mr.  Rabbit, please move this stone away (挪走) from my back, or I will die (死) . The rabbit helps the wolf. Then the wolf jumps up and catches the rabbit. He wants to eat the rabbit. The rabbit cries, “I help you.  How can you kill (杀) me? It's unfair.  Let's ask Mrs Fox.  She will say you're wrong. ”“OK.  She will say I can eat you. ” The fox listens to their story and says, “Which stone? Let me have a look.  Then I will know who is right. ”So the wolf, the rabbit and the fox go to see the stone. “Now put the stone back,” says the fox, and they put the stone back on the wolf's back again. After that, the fox and the rabbit go away. 

一天，一只兔子在河边散步。一只狼在喊:“救命!救命!”狼的背上有一块大石头。“兔子先生，请把这块石头从我背上移开，否则我会死。”兔子帮助了狼。然后狼跳起来抓住了兔子。他想吃兔子。兔子叫道:“我帮你。你怎么能杀死我?这是不公平的。让我们问问狐狸太太。她会说你错了。”“好吧。她会说我能吃了你。”狐狸听了他们的故事，说:“哪块石头?让我看看。这样我就知道谁是对的了。”于是，狼、兔子和狐狸一起去看石头。“现在把石头放回去，”狐狸说，他们又把石头放回狼的背上。在那之后，狐狸和兔子离开了。
