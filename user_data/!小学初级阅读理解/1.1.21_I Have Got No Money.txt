I Have Got No Money
我没钱

It was very hot last Wednesday. A big, strong man went into a bar（酒吧）, sat down, called the waiter, “Give me a bottle of beer（啤酒）before the troubles（麻烦）start. ”

上周三天气很热。一个高大强壮的男人走进酒吧，坐下来，叫服务员，“在麻烦开始之前给我一瓶啤酒。”

The waiter was busy with other people, so he did not say anything, but he gave the man a bottle of beer. The man drank it quickly. Then he called the waiter again, “Give me another one before the troubles start. ”Again the waiter was too busy to say anything. So he gave the man another bottle of beer. The man drank it, too. 

服务员正忙于服务其他人，所以他什么也没说，但他给了男人一瓶啤酒。男人很快就喝完了。然后他又叫服务员:“在麻烦开始之前，再给我来一杯。”服务员因为太忙了，还是没顾得上说话。于是他又给了男人一瓶啤酒。男人也喝了。

Then again he called the waiter, “One more bottle of beer before the troubles start!”This time the waiter was not very busy, so when he brought the man his third bottle of beer, he said to him, “What troubles are you talking about?”The man shouted, “I have got no money. ”

然后他再次对服务员说:“麻烦开始之前，再来一瓶啤酒!”这一次，服务员不太忙，所以当他给他第三瓶啤酒时，他对男人说:“你在说什么麻烦?”男人喊道:“我没有钱。”
