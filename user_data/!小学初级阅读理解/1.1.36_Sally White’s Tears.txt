Sally White’s Tears
怀特女士的眼泪

Sally White was a very kind teacher. She worked in a primary school （小学）. Her home was not far（远）from her school, and she always walked there every morning. All the students in her class were very young. They all liked Miss White. One day, Miss White walked to school on a very cold and windy morning. The cold wind went into her eyes, and some big tears （泪水） began running out of her eyes. She got to the school, opened the door and went into the classroom. It was nice and warm in the classroom and she was happy. Suddenly, a little boy stood up and looked at her for a moment. Then the little boy went out of his seat and came to Miss White. He put his arms round her and said kindly, "Don't cry, Miss White, school isn't very bad. "
