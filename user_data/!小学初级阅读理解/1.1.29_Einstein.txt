爱因斯坦

Einstein was a great scientist in the world. He was born in Germany in 1879 and in 1932 he had to leave his country and moved to America. He stayed there for twenty-three years until he died（死亡）. 

爱因斯坦是世界上一位伟大的科学家。他于1879年出生在德国，1932年他不得不离开自己的国家移居美国。他在那里呆了二十三年，直到去世。

One day the scientist went to New York for a meeting. The train didn't arrive on time, so no one met him at the station. He didn't know where to go. Then he felt kind of hungry, so he went into a restaurant and sat down at a table. Just then he remembered an important problem and started to think about it. 

一天，这位科学家去纽约开会。火车没有准时到达，所以没有人去车站接他。他不知道该去哪里。然后他觉得有点饿了，于是他走进一家餐馆，在一张桌子旁坐下。就在这时，他想起了一个重要的问题，并开始思考。

A young man came up to him and asked, "May I take your order, sir?"Einstein looked at the menu（菜单） for a long time, but he couldn't see anything on it. At last, he found he didn't wear his glasses. He didn't want to take his glasses out, so he said, "Please read it for me. "

一个年轻人走过来问他:“先生，您要点什么?”爱因斯坦盯着菜单看了很长时间，但他什么也看不见。最后，他发现他没有戴眼镜。他不想把眼镜拿出来，所以他说:“请读给我听。”

The young man looked around and said in his ear, "Sorry, sir.  I can't read, either. "

年轻人环顾四周，对着他的耳朵说:“对不起，先生，我也不识字。”
