Save Life, Save Soul
拯救生命，拯救灵魂

He really did look like a tourist, with a camera around his neck and a bottle of sunscreen cream sticking out of his bag. The fat man sat on the terrace （平台）， sipping lemonade and pretending to look at a tourism brochure. His sunglasses masked his eyes, but I knew he wasn't looking at the brochure: he hadn't turned a page for the last ten minutes. As I brought him his dishes, he coughed up a "thank you" and looked at me briefly. I tried not to stare at the tiny scar across his left eyebrow. 

他看起来确实像个游客，脖子上挂着相机，包里伸出一瓶防晒霜。胖子坐在阳台上，喝着柠檬水，假装在看旅游宣传册。他的太阳镜遮住了眼睛，但我知道他没有在看宣传册:他已经有十分钟没有翻过一页了。当我把菜端给他时，他咳出一句“谢谢”，并简短地看了我一眼。我尽量不去看他左眉上的小伤疤。

I walked back inside with my empty tray, shaking my head. He looked familiar, but I couldn't quite place him. Then it hit me. The car accident. The mysterious stranger who helped me out of my crashed car, just before it exploded. I rushed back to his table. He was gone. 

我摇着头，端着空盘子走回屋里。他看起来面熟，但我认不出他是谁。然后我恍然大悟。车祸。那个神秘的陌生人把我从撞坏的车里救了出来，就在车爆炸之前。我冲回他的桌子。他走了。

I moved his saucer and found his tip, along with a card： I am deeply grateful to you. The night o£ your car accident, I was on my way to rob a jewelry store. Saving your life brought things back in the right way. I now live an honest life, thanks to you. God bless you! Mr.  D. 

我打开他的茶碟，找到了小费，还有一张卡片:我深深地感谢您。你出车祸的那天晚上，我正要去抢劫一家珠宝店。救了你的命让一切回到正轨。多亏了你，我现在过着诚实的生活。愿上帝保佑你!D先生。

I shivered（震颤）. The night of my car accident, I was heading for an interview in an illegal dance club. Seeing human kindness through his heroic gesture turned my life around and brought faith back into my life. I unfolded the tip he left. Among the singles was a grand （—千块）with a pen mark underlining "In God We Trust. "I said a silent prayer for him and got back to work, smiling. 

我哆嗦了一下。我出车祸的那天晚上，我正要去一家非法的舞蹈俱乐部参加面试。通过他的英勇举动，我看到了人性的善良，这改变了我的生活，让我的生活重新充满了信心。我打开他留下的小费。在这些小费中，有一千块上面写着“我们相信上帝”。我默默地为他祈祷，然后微笑着回去工作。
