Globalized Cross-Cultural Communication
全球化的跨文化交流

I still remember my father's embarrassment the day when he was invited to have dinner at a colleague's house. Freshly arriving in Brazil, and not being able to look up on the Internet, he offended his hosts by making a hand gesture — a circle with the thumb and index finger. He had always understood it to mean “OK”, but in Brazil, it meant something different. 

我还记得有一天我父亲被邀请到同事家吃饭时的尴尬。刚到巴西，由于无法上网，他做了一个手势——用拇指和食指画一个圈，冒犯了东道主。他一直把它理解为“OK”的意思，但在巴西，它的意思不同。

The episode was swiftly forgotten. My father's colleague understood that he probably wasn't yet aware of the local meaning of the gesture. He gently explained it meant something rude, and then it was filed away under “things not to be done in Rio”. 

这件事很快就被忘记了。我父亲的同事明白，他可能还不知道这个手势在当地的含义。他温和地解释说，这意味着一些粗鲁的事情，然后它被归档在“不能在里约热内卢做的事情”下面。

I was reminded myself in China. After I replied to a friend's WeChat message with a Van Gogh sticker that I thought meant “keep fighting”, another friend told me I used it wrong. 

在中国，我提醒自己。在我回复一个朋友的微信消息时，我用了一个梵高的贴纸，我以为它的意思是“继续战斗”，另一个朋友说我用错了。

“The Chinese version is a bit different,” she said, taking out her phone and showing to me.  “See these characters? They mean ‘I will hit you!’”

“中国版有点不同，”她说着，拿出手机给我看。“看到这些字了吗?他们的意思是‘我要打你!’”

Life is full of crossed meanings. In India, you sign to someone to come over with your palm down, not up. And in the Middle East, you never use your left hand for anything public. 

生活充满了交叉的意义。在印度，你示意某人过来时手掌要朝下，而不是朝上。在中东，你在公共场合从不用左手。

As adults, we understand that even if it hurts, a mistake is only an insult when it is deliberate. Yet, many conflicts come from misunderstanding, and history is full of the unfortunate outcomes of cross-cultural communication. 

作为成年人，我们明白即使犯错很伤人，但如果是故意犯错，那也只是一种侮辱。然而，许多冲突源于误解，历史上充满了跨文化交流的不幸结果。

My father's pre-Internet Brazilian mistake was forgiven because of context — he had just arrived and he didn't know its local meaning. But when context is absent or simply differently understood — especially in the social media — perhaps it is time we all think twice before typing or talking, especially when the consequences can be more severe than the misuse of a WeChat sticker. 

在互联网出现之前，我父亲犯的巴西错误被原谅了，因为当时他刚到巴西，不知道这个词在当地的意思。但当上下文缺失或理解不同时——尤其是在社交媒体上——也许我们在打字或说话前都应该三思，尤其是当后果可能比滥用微信贴纸更严重的时候。
