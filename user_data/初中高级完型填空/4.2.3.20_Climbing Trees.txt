Climbing Trees
爬树

A group of boys stood around a tree. "What a tall tree!" they said to each other, "It would be exciting to climb to the top!”. 

一群男孩围着一棵树站着。“多高的一棵树啊!”他们彼此说，“爬到树顶该多刺激啊!”

The group of boys then decided to play a game to see who could climb to the top of the tree first. Their mothers were sitting not far away, looking on at their children as they played. 

然后，这群男孩决定玩一个游戏，看谁能先爬到树顶。他们的母亲坐在不远处，看着孩子们玩耍。

One of the climbers was an 8-year-old boy named David. He was the shortest child in the group. Nobody thought he would win. 

其中一名登山者是一个名叫大卫的8岁男孩。他是一群孩子中最矮的。没人认为他会赢。

Then the game started. All of the boys tried their best to climb as high as they could. Although the other boys climbed faster than David in the beginning, he got to the top of the tree fastest in the end. 

然后游戏开始了。所有的男孩都尽了最大的努力爬得越高越好。虽然其他男孩一开始比大卫爬得快，但最后他爬到树顶的速度最快。

His mother was proud， She asked him, "David, how did you reach the top of the tree so quickly?"

他的妈妈很骄傲，她问他:“大卫，你怎么这么快就爬上了树顶?”

“It was easy, " David said, The other children kept looking down as they climbed.  When they realized how high they were, they were afraid of falling down I, however, looked only up.  When I saw how close I was, I kept going higher and higher until I reached the top. "

“这很容易，”大卫说。当他们爬上去的时候，其他的孩子一直往下看。当他们意识到自己有多高时，他们害怕掉下来，而我只是抬头看。当我看到自己离山顶有多近时，我就越爬越高，直到到达山顶。”

It is true in life that if we just keep going forward without looking back, we are more likely to reach our goals. 

在生活中，如果我们一直向前而不回头，我们就更有可能达到我们的目标。
