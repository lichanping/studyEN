Mona's Dream Job
莫娜梦寐以求的工作

Mona works for Tonight magazine. Every week, she writes about the new movies and gives them ratings（等级）from **** （excellent） to * （awful）. She sees at least two movies a day, but she doesn't write about everything she sees. I only give reviews（评论）to the most important movies—good or bad!

莫娜在《今夜》杂志工作每周，她都会写一些关于新电影的文章，并给出从****(优秀)到*(糟糕)的评分。她每天至少看两部电影，但她不会把她看到的一切都写下来。我只给最重要的电影影评——好或坏!

It's a dream job for Mona. She studied film making in college. I've always loved watching movies, she said.  "And it's fun to see a new movie, before anyone has seen it. "

这是莫娜梦寐以求的工作她在大学里学的是电影制作。“我一直很喜欢看电影，”她说。“在别人看过一部新电影之前，去看它是很有趣的。”

Mona works hard. Some days, she sees three or even four movies a day— starting in the afternoon and finishing at midnight. It's not always easy to stay awake for the last movie. She makes notes about each movie right after she sees it. Then, the next day, she writes her reviews in the afternoon before going to see more movies!

莫娜工作很努力。有些日子，她一天看三到四部电影——从下午开始，到午夜结束。在最后一部电影中保持清醒并不总是那么容易。她在看完每一部电影后都会做笔记。然后，第二天，在去看更多的电影之前，她在下午写评论!

Though Mona gets plenty of e-mails from people who don't agree with her opinions, she really enjoys her job. She said, "I'm happy when I can get more attention for movies made by young actors and filmmakers. Sometimes can really help with their careers（职业）. I'm not famous, but millions of people enjoy my work!"And it's great that so many people read my reviews every week in Tonight.

虽然莫娜收到很多不同意她意见的人发来的电子邮件，但她真的很喜欢她的工作。她说:“我很高兴看到年轻演员和电影人制作的电影得到更多关注。有时候会对他们的事业有帮助。我并不出名，但数百万人喜欢我的作品!”每周都有这么多人看我在《今夜秀》上的评论，真是太好了。
