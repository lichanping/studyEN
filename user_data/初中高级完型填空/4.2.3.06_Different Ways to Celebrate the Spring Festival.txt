Different Ways to Celebrate the Spring Festival
庆祝春节的不同方式

The Spring Festival marks the first day of a new year，so the first meal is rather important．People from the North and the South have different habits about the foods they eat on this special day．In Northern China，people usually eat Jiaozi．The word Jiaozi in Chinese means the end of winter and the beginning of spring．According to historical records（记载） ，in the past people from the North and the South both ate Jiaozi on Chinese New Year's Day．Perhaps because the areas in Southern China produced more rice than those in Northern China，southern people slowly began to eat many other kinds of food on New Year's Day．Besides ，the most common foods for the first meal are noodles，New Year Cake and Tangyuan．The noodle is a symbol of long life．The New Year Cake is called Niangao in Chinese，which represents（代表） the hope of improvement in life year after year．Tangyuan is a symbol of family reunion according to the Chinese．

春节标志着新年的第一天，所以第一顿饭是相当重要的。来自北方和南方的人们在这个特殊的日子里吃的食物有不同的习惯。在中国北方，人们通常吃饺子。饺子在中文里意味着冬天的结束和春天的开始。根据历史记载，在过去的中国新年，南方人和北方人都吃饺子。也许是因为中国南方地区比北方地区生产更多的大米，南方人慢慢地开始在元旦吃许多其他种类的食物。此外，年夜饭最常见的食物是面条、年糕和汤圆。面条是长寿的象征。年糕在中国被称为年糕，它代表着年复一年生活改善的希望。汤圆在中国人看来是家庭团聚的象征。

To pay a New Year visit to relatives and friends is an important activity during the Spring Festival．People also send cards to express a New Year's greeting．What children love most is to set off firecrackers（烟花爆竹）．However ，as the pace of life is becoming faster and faster，people have taken up new ways to celebrate the Chinese traditional New Year．For example，many people no longer send out greeting cards．Instead ，they use short messages or emails．Also to travel during the New Year holidays has come into fashion．

拜年走亲访友是春节期间的一项重要活动。人们也送卡片来表达新年的问候。孩子们最喜欢的是放鞭炮。然而，随着生活节奏变得越来越快，人们采取了新的方式来庆祝中国传统的新年。例如，许多人不再发送贺卡。相反，他们使用短信或电子邮件。此外，在新年假期旅行已成为一种时尚。
