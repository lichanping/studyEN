A Loaf of Special Bread
一条特殊的面包

People once went hungry．A rich man who made bread and cakes sent for twenty of the poorest children in the town，and told them to take a loaf（条）of bread from a basket.​

人们曾经挨饿。一个做面包和蛋糕的富人派人去找了镇上二十个最穷孩子，并告诉他们从篮子里拿出一条面包。

The hungry children came together excitedly, and argued for the bread，because each wished to have the largest one．Finally, they went away without even thanking the good gentleman．

饥饿的孩子们兴奋地聚在一起，争抢面包，因为每个人都想要最大的那个。最后，他们甚至没有感谢这位好心的绅士就走了。

But Gretchen，a poorly dressed little girl，did not argue or fight with the rest，but remained standing quietly far away from them．When the bad﹣mannered girls left，she took the smallest bread，which alone was left in the basket，kissed the gentleman's hand，and went home．

但是格雷琴，一个衣衫褴褛的小女孩，没有和其他人争论或打架，而是静静地站在远离他们的地方。当那些没礼貌的女孩离开后，她拿起篮子里唯一剩下的最小的面包，吻了吻绅士的手，然后回家了。

The next day the children were as bad﹣mannered as before，and poor，shy Gretchen received a loaf hardly the size of the one she got the first day．When she came home，her mother cut the loaf open．Many new shining pieces of silver fell out of it．

第二天，孩子们还是像以前一样不礼貌，可怜的、害羞的格雷琴收到了一个面包，几乎还没有她第一天得到的那么大。当她回到家时，她妈妈切开了面包。许多新的闪亮的银币从里面掉了出来。

Her mother was very surprised and worried，and said，"Take the money back to the good gentleman at once，for it must have got into the dough（生面团) by mistake．Be quick，Gretchen! Be quick!"

她的母亲非常惊讶和担心，说：“马上把钱还给这位好先生，因为它一定是不小心进了面团。快点，格雷琴！快点！”

But when the little girl gave the rich man her mother's message, he said，"No，no，my child，it was no mistake. I had the silver pieces put into the smallest loaf to give you. Always be as satisfied，quiet，and thankful as you now are．Go home now，and tell your mother that money is your own．"

但是当小女孩把她妈妈的话告诉富人时，富人说：“不，不，我的孩子，我没有弄错。我让人把银币放进最小的面包里给你。永远要像现在这样满足、安静、感恩。现在回家吧，告诉你妈妈钱是你自己的。”
