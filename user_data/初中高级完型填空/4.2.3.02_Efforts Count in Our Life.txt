Efforts Count in Our Life
努力在我们人生中很重要

It was an unforgettable night. The noisy Mexico City gradually calmed down . The main Olympic stadium was in darkness.

那是一个难忘的夜晚。喧闹的墨西哥城渐渐平静下来。奥林匹克主体育场一片漆黑。

After he finished making the scenes that the marathon（马拉松） winners celebrated the victory, Greenspan, a world famous documentary producer, found the stadium empty . He was leaving for the hotel when he suddenly saw a man running into the stadium. The man ran out of breath, but he didn't stop. After he got to the goal, he fell down on the ground.

世界著名纪录片制作人格林斯潘在拍摄完马拉松获胜者庆祝胜利的场景后，发现体育馆空无一人。他正要去旅馆，突然看见一个人跑进体育场。那人跑得上气不接下气，但他没有停下来。他到达球门后，倒在了地上。

Greenspan guessed this was a marathon athlete, so he went over to ask why the athlete ran to the goal with such a difficulty. The young man replied, "That my country sent me there is to make me complete the game, not let me start a race in the competition.  I have fallen behind all other runners, but I have a goal like them.  I will run to the goal because my motherland is watching me from behind. "

格林斯潘猜这是一个马拉松运动员，于是他走过去问为什么运动员跑到终点这么困难。年轻人回答说:“我的国家派我来是为了让我完成比赛，而不是让我在比赛中开始赛跑。我落后于所有其他跑步者，但我有一个和他们一样的目标。我会跑向目标，因为我的祖国在后面看着我。”

Moved by what he said, Greenspan spread the most touching scene in the history of the Olympic Games to every corner of the world.

格林斯潘深受感动，把奥运会历史上最感人的一幕传遍了世界各个角落。

Life should have a dream of reaching the peak（顶点）, yet the most important is not whether we can reach the peak but whether we have made the greatest efforts—to reach the goal in the mind is a success.

人生应该有一个登峰造极的梦想，但最重要的不是我们是否达到了顶峰，而是我们是否付出了最大的努力——达到了心中的目标就是成功。
