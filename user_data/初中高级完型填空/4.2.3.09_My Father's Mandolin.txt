My Father's Mandolin
父亲的曼陀林琴

My father was a self-taught mandolin（曼陀林琴） player.He was one of the best players in our town.He could not read music, but if he heard a tune（曲子） a few times, he could play it.When he was young, he was a member of a small country music band.They played at local dances and played for the local radio station on a few occasions.

我父亲是一位自学成才的曼陀林演奏家。他是我们镇上最好的演奏家之一。他看不懂乐谱，但如果他听几遍曲子，他就能弹出来。他年轻时是一个小型乡村乐队的成员。他们在当地的舞会上演奏，并为当地的广播电台演奏过几次。

At home, Dad often took out his mandolin and played for the family.We three children sang along.Nobody played the mandolin like my father.He could touch your heart with the music that came out of that old mandolin.He seemed to shine when he was playing.You could see his pride in his ability to play so well for his family.

在家里，爸爸经常拿出他的曼陀林为家人演奏。我们三个孩子一起唱。没有人像我父亲那样弹奏曼陀林。他可以用那古老的曼陀林发出的音乐触动你的心。他在比赛时似乎闪闪发光。你可以看到他为自己的家庭演奏得如此出色而感到自豪。

But Dad had to find another job in a factory later because the money he made at the band wasn't enough to support the family.Unluckily he had an accident one day and lost one finger.He couldn't play as well as before.From then on, every time we asked him to play, he would make up excuses to turn down our request.However, we missed his performances so much.Finally, he agreed and said, "Okay, but remember, I can't hold down the strings （琴弦） the way I used to."

但是后来爸爸不得不在一家工厂找了另一份工作，因为他在乐队挣的钱不足以养家糊口。不幸的是，有一天他出了事故，失去了一根手指。他不能像以前那样打得好了。从那以后，每次我们请他玩，他都会编造借口拒绝我们的要求。然而，我们非常想念他的表演。最后，他同意了，并说:“好吧，但是记住，我不能像以前那样按住琴弦了。”

When he played the old mandolin, it carried us back to a cheerful, happy time in our lives.Dad was that kind of man.Giving was what he was doing all his life.If he could give pleasure to others, he would, especially his family.He was always there, sacrificing（牺牲） his time to see that his family had enough in their life.

当他弹奏古老的曼陀林时，它把我们带回到我们生活中快乐的时光。爸爸就是这样的人。奉献是他一生的事业。如果他能给别人带来快乐，他会的，尤其是他的家人。他总是在那里，牺牲他的时间来确保他的家人有足够的生活。
