Save Paper
节约用纸

In the 13th century, Marco Polo travelled a long way to China. He was a famous Italian traveller. During his stay in China, he saw many wonderful things. One of the things he discovered was that the Chinese used paper money. People in Western countries didn't use paper money until the 17th century. However,people in China began to use paper money in the 10th century. Paper was invented by a Chinese person about 2000 years ago. His name was Cai Lun. He then put these pieces of paper together and made them into a book.

13世纪，马可波罗长途跋涉来到中国。他是一位著名的意大利旅行家。在中国逗留期间，他看到了许多美好的事物。他发现的一件事是中国人使用纸币。西方国家的人们直到17世纪才开始使用纸币。然而，中国人在10世纪开始使用纸币。纸是大约2000年前由一个中国人发明的。他的名字叫蔡伦。然后他把这些纸拼在一起，做成了一本书。

Now paper mainly comes from trees. We use it every day. Sometimes we waste a lot of it. If we keep on doing so, people have to cut down many more trees. Then there will not be any trees left. If there are no trees, there will be no paper. 

现在纸张主要来自树木。我们每天都在使用它。有时我们浪费了很多时间。如果我们继续这样做，人们不得不砍伐更多的树木。这样就不会有树了。如果没有树木，就不会有纸。

So how can we save paper?When we make notes, we can use both sides of each piece of paper. We can buy drinks in bottles instead of those in paper packets. We can also use cotton handkerchiefs and not paper ones. When we go shopping, we can use fewer paper bags. If the salesman gives us a paper bag, we can keep it and reuse it later. We can help to protect trees if we think carefully. We should do it now, before it is too late.

那么我们怎样才能节约纸张呢?当我们做笔记时，我们可以使用每张纸的两面。我们可以买瓶装的饮料，而不是纸包装的。我们也可以用棉手帕而不是纸手帕。当我们去购物时，我们可以使用更少的纸袋。如果售货员给我们一个纸袋，我们可以留着以后再用。如果我们仔细思考，我们可以帮助保护树木。我们现在就应该做，否则就太晚了。
