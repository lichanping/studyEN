Playing the Piano
弹钢琴

Playing a musical instrument is a great hobby.I started playing the piano when I was five years old and I still enjoy it now: it is a perfect way to relax and can cheer me up when I'm feeling down.When I lived at home with my parents, we had a brown piano in the house and I had piano lessons every week.However, when I went to university, I had to leave my family and my piano behind.

演奏乐器是一个很好的爱好。我五岁的时候开始弹钢琴，现在我仍然喜欢它：它是一种完美的放松方式，当我情绪低落的时候，它能让我振作起来。当我和父母住在一起的时候，我们家有一架棕色的钢琴，我每周都上钢琴课。然而，当我上大学的时候，我不得不离开我的家庭和我的钢琴。

I enjoyed playing the piano so much that I spend all the money I got for my birthday on a new electric piano.It was quite difficult to get it from the music shop: I had to ask a friend to help me get the piano into a taxi and then move it to the door.I was able to play whenever I wanted, using earphones so that I wouldn't disturb （打扰） my roommates.When I got tired of studying or writing an essay, I would take a break by playing something energetic.It really helped me feel relaxed and happy!When I was feeling a bit homesick （想家的）, playing music that I learned on my old piano made me feel better.

我非常喜欢弹钢琴，所以我把生日收到的所有钱都花在了一架新的电子钢琴上。从乐器店把钢琴弄来相当困难:我不得不请一个朋友帮我把钢琴搬上一辆出租车，然后把它搬到门口。我可以随时用耳机玩，这样我就不会打扰到我的室友。当我厌倦了学习或写文章时，我会通过玩一些有活力的东西来休息。它真的让我感到放松和快乐!当我有点想家的时候，在我的旧钢琴上弹奏我学过的音乐让我感觉好多了。

Now I am studying abroad and I don't have a piano with me.When I'm listening to a tune that I can play , I feel nostalgic （怀旧的） about the piano keyboard.I wish that pianos were as portable （轻便的） as guitars because I really want to spend time on my hobby.Luckily, there are other activities that I can do to relax, like drawing or writing stories.

现在我在国外学习，我没有带钢琴。当我听一首我会弹的曲子时，我就会怀念钢琴键盘。我希望钢琴能像吉他一样便携，因为我真的想把时间花在我的爱好上。幸运的是，我还可以做其他活动来放松，比如画画或写故事。
