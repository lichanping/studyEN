The Best Gift for My Father
给我爸爸最好的礼物

My father and I always had a bit of trouble in our relationship. It's nor that we didn't love each other. It's just that we used to have different opinions. My dad is one of the most hard-working men I know, but I was a dreamer. I played sports when I was a kid, but gave up when I was making progress. Then I showed an interest in music. My father got excited and bought me a guitar when I was about eight. But I really didn't like it until I was a teenager. During those teen years, I got up my guitar and began playing along. 

我父亲和我的关系总是有点问题。并不是说我们不爱对方。只是我们以前意见不一致。我父亲是我认识的最努力工作的人之一，但我是个梦想家。当我还是个孩子的时候我喜欢运动，但是当我取得进步的时候就放弃了。后来我对音乐产生了兴趣。我父亲很兴奋，在我八岁的时候给我买了一把吉他。但我真的不喜欢它，直到我成为了一个青少年。在那十几岁的时候，我拿起吉他，开始跟着演奏。

Then I went to college. My father thought I should pay more attention to my studies while I thought I should have more fun playing music. I had to accept treatments all my life, or get a transplant（移植）. I dreamed to be a musician. When I grew into a young man, I suddenly fell seriously ill one day and it was discovered that I had a terrible kidney disease（肾病）. 

后来我上了大学。我父亲认为我应该更多地关注我的学习，而我认为我应该有更多的乐趣玩音乐。我一生都需要接受治疗，或者接受器官移植。我梦想成为一名音乐家。当我长大成人后，有一天我突然生了一场重病，医生发现我得了一种可怕的肾病。

I felt like there was a heavy weight on my shoulders. Life became hard for me. But I was lucky enough because of my loving parents who encouraged me and took care of me. While trying to decide just what to do with my life, my father got tested to see whether he was the right man to give me his kidney. I tried to refuse, but he'd hear none of it. He saved my life at last. 

我觉得肩上的担子很重。生活对我来说变得很艰难。但我很幸运，因为我慈爱的父母鼓励我，照顾我。当我在考虑如何度过我的一生时，我父亲接受了检查，看他是否适合把他的肾给我。我试图拒绝，但他听不进去。他最后救了我的命。

Two years ago, I made up a band. He had always wanted to play in a band, but never got the chance when he was young. It was one of the greatest gifts I could give to him. 

两年前，我组建了一个乐队。他一直想在乐队里演奏，但年轻时一直没有机会。这是我能给他的最好的礼物之一。
