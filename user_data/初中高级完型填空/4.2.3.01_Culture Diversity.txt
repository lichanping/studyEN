Culture Diversity
文化差异

In most cultures, when people meet, they usually greet each other. Once a young woman from England went to China to study. She knew little about Chinese culture when she first arrived.  One day on her way to school, she went to a bank to get some money. To her surprise, the bank clerk asked her if she had had lunch. She was surprised at such a question because, in British culture, it would mean an invitation to lunch. So she quickly answered that she had already eaten. After that, she went on to the school and was even more surprised when one teacher asked her the same question. 

在大多数文化中，当人们见面时，他们通常会互相问候。从前，一位年轻的英国女子到中国学习。她初到中国时对中国文化知之甚少。一天，在上学的路上，她去银行取钱。令她吃惊的是，银行职员问她是否吃过午饭。她对这样的问题感到惊讶，因为在英国文化中，这意味着邀请吃午饭。所以她很快回答说她已经吃过了。之后，她去了学校，更让她惊讶的是，一位老师问了她同样的问题。

Now she understood that it couldn't be an invitation. And she was puzzled （困惑的） why they asked it. In the following days, she was asked the same question again and again so she spent many hours trying to find out why so many people kept asking this. At last, she thought that these people must care about her health. She was quite thin at that time and she thought they must be worrying that she was not eating well. 

现在她明白了，那不可能是邀请。她很纳闷他们为什么要问这个问题。在接下来的几天里，她一次又一次地被问到同样的问题，所以她花了很多时间试图弄清楚为什么这么多人一直问这个问题。最后，她想这些人一定很关心她的健康。她当时很瘦，她想他们一定是担心她吃得不好。
