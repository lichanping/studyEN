The Red Flowers Growing on the Moon
月球上盛开的红花

In space, there was a little gray planet.It looked very sad , because the people who lived there hadn't looked after it.They had polluted the whole planet heavily with rubbish and pollution.As a result, there were few plants and animals left.

在太空中，有一颗灰色的小行星。它看起来很悲伤，因为住在那里的人没有照顾它。他们用垃圾和污染严重污染了整个星球。结果，几乎没有植物和动物留下。

One day, a little boy Jim was walking on the planet, when he passed a cave（山洞）and noticed a small red flower inside.The flower was very sick — almost dying, so Jim carefully dug up the flower, with roots, soil and everything.Then he started looking for a place to take care of it.He searched all over the planet, but everywhere was polluted so much that there was no place the flower could possibly live in.Then he looked up at the moon.It seemed that maybe the plant could live there.

有一天，一个小男孩吉姆在星球上行走，当他经过一个洞穴时，注意到里面有一朵红色的小花。这朵花病得很重，几乎要死了，所以吉姆小心地把花挖了出来，连根、土和所有的东西都挖了出来。然后他开始寻找一个地方来处理它。他找遍了整个星球，但到处都被污染得如此严重，以至于没有花可以生存的地方。然后他抬头看了看月亮。这种植物似乎可以在那里生存。

Jim decided to go there.He climbed into a spaceship and put the little red flower in the back, then they flew to the moon.Far away from all that pollution, the flower soon grew up, giving birth to others, and these other flowers spread onto other flowers.When the little boy's flowers came out, the moon gave out a soft red light.It was the most beautiful scenery he had ever seen.

吉姆决定去那里。他爬进一艘宇宙飞船，把小红花放在后面，然后他们飞向月球。远离所有的污染，这朵花很快就长大了，生出了其他的花，这些花又传播到其他的花上。当小男孩的花出来的时候，月亮发出了柔和的红光。这是他所见过的最美丽的风景。

Maybe the story is telling us if we don't look after the planet, a day will come when flowers can only grow on the moon.So we must be friendly to our place that we are living in now.

也许这个故事是在告诉我们，如果我们不照顾地球，总有一天，花只能生长在月球上。所以我们必须对我们现在居住的地方友好。
