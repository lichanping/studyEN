Music Can Reduce the Blue
音乐能够减轻低落的心情

I was feeling a little blue because my mother had lost her job.

我感到有点沮丧，因为我妈妈丢了工作。

One day, while I was walking on the street, I heard the piano music and singing rising above the noise of the people.I walked more slowly to find out where it was coming from. Then I saw a young lady sitting at a piano.

有一天，当我走在街上时，我听到钢琴音乐和歌声盖过了人群的嘈杂声。我走得慢了些，想看看声音是从哪里来的。然后我看见一位年轻女士坐在钢琴旁。

She was singing songs about love, believing in yourself and keeping on trying.The way she was singing made me a little comfortable.I stood there quietly, watching her playing in such a crowded New York square.I thought that she must be brave enough to perform in front of so many people.

她唱着关于爱的歌，相信自己，继续努力。她唱歌的方式让我觉得有点舒服。我静静地站在那里，看着她在如此拥挤的纽约广场上玩耍。我想她一定很勇敢，能在这么多人面前表演。

She noticed me: I walked over and told her how good her music sounded."Thank you," she said.

她注意到了我，我走过去告诉她她的音乐听起来有多好。“谢谢你，”她说。

"I have been going through a hard time recently, but you've made me hopeful again." I said to her.

“我最近经历了一段艰难的时期，但你让我重新充满了希望。”我对她说。

"I'm glad that I could help," she replied. "Why are you so sad?"

“我很高兴能帮上忙，”她回答。“你为什么这么伤心?”

"Well, my mum has lost her job, and I'm not sure what to do.”

“嗯，我妈妈失业了，我不知道该怎么办。”

"Did you notice the way you were walking? Your head was down." she said. "Don't be upset, because opportunities come different ways and if your head is down, you might not see it.You should smile more and lift your head up."

“你注意到你走路的样子了吗?”你的头低着。”她说。“不要沮丧，因为机会会以不同的方式出现，如果你低着头，你可能看不到它。”你应该多笑笑，抬起头来。”

I looked at her, amazed at how she was encouraging me."Why are you playing the piano here?" I asked her with a smile.

我看着她，惊讶于她是如何鼓励我的。“你为什么在这里弹钢琴?”我笑着问她。

She explained that she saw a lot of unhappy people in the world and she tried to cheer them up by playing music.

她解释说，她看到世界上有很多不快乐的人，她试图通过演奏音乐来让他们振作起来。

I smiled a little wilder, realizing that no difficulties could stop me from going on.

我笑得更狂野了，意识到任何困难都不能阻止我继续前进。
