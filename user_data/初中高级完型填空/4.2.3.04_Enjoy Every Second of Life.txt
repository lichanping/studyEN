Enjoy Every Second of Life
享受生活的每一秒

I sat down to read under an old tree in the park.I felt my life was hopeless, for my whole world was dark.a young boy ran up to me, out of breath.He stood right before me with his head down and said excitedly, "Look, what I've found!"In his hand was a flower, and what a poor sight.The flower was dry and dead.I gave him a small smile and then turned my eyes away so that he could take his dry flower and go off to play.

我在公园的一棵老树下坐下来看书。我觉得我的生活没有希望了，因为我的整个世界都是黑暗的。一个小男孩上气不接下气地向我跑来。他低着头站在我面前，兴奋地说:“看，我找到了什么!”他手里拿着一朵花，真是难看极了。这朵花干了，死了。我对他微微一笑，然后把目光移开，好让他拿着干花，不去关注然后去玩。

However, he sat next to my side and placed the flower to his nose and said in surprise, "It smells sweet and it's beautiful, too. That's why I picked it. Here, it's for you."The flower before me was dead.But I knew I must accept it, or he might never leave.So I accepted the flower, and replied, "This is just what I want."Just then, for the first time I noticed that the boy could not see, because he was blind.

然而，他坐在我身边，把花放在他的鼻子上，惊讶地说:“它闻起来很香，也很漂亮。这就是我选它的原因。这是给你的。”我面前的花死了。但我知道我必须接受，否则他可能永远不会离开。于是我收下了这朵花，回答说:“这正是我想要的。”就在那时，我第一次注意到这个男孩看不见，因为他是盲人。

Tears came down my face as I thanked him for picking the best one.You're welcome, he smiled and then ran off to play.I sat there and wondered how he was able to learn about my pain.Through the eyes of a blind child, at last I could see the problem was not with the world; the problem was me.And for all those years I myself had been blind.I decided to see the beauty in life, and enjoy every second of my life.And then I held that dry flower up to my nose and breathed in the smell of a beautiful rose.

当我感谢他挑了最好的一个时，眼泪顺着我的脸流下来了。不客气，他笑了笑，然后跑去玩了。我坐在那里，想知道他是怎么知道我的痛苦的。通过一个盲童的眼睛，我终于看到问题不在于这个世界;问题出在我身上。这些年来，我自己一直是盲人。我决定去发现生活中的美好，享受生命中的每一秒。然后我把那朵干花凑近鼻子，吸进了美丽玫瑰的香味。
