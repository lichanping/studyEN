Everyone is Unique
每个人都是独一无二的

When I was in middle school, I felt I was always letting people down.Once I brought my friend Daisy to my home.I noticed that all my family members seemed to like Daisy better than me.

当我在中学的时候，我觉得我总是让人们失望。有一次我把我的朋友黛西带到家里。我注意到我所有的家人似乎都比我更喜欢黛西。

I felt very sad.I even thought they didn't love me.I wondered whether they would miss me if I died some day.So I told my mum, "Daisy is more patient than I have ever been. You must want her to be your daughter instead of me."

我感到伤心。我甚至认为他们不爱我。我在想，如果有一天我死了，他们会不会想我。所以我告诉妈妈：“不论在什么时候，黛西比我更有耐心。你一定想让她做你的女儿，而不是我。”

My mum explained that Daisy was a lovely girl, but nobody could replace (代替) me in the family.She said I was the only person who could fill my role.She made me realize that even if I made mistakes, I was a beloved member of the family who could never be replaced.

我妈妈解释说黛西是很可爱，但没有人能取代她我在家里的地位。她说我是唯一能胜任我这个角色的人。她让我意识到，即使我犯了错误，我也是这个家庭中受人爱戴的一员，永远无法取代。

From then on, I tried to find out who I was and what made me special.I look at myself in a new way.Then I started to be positive (积极的) towards my life, and I was happy about who I really was.I came to feel much better as I knew that no one could ever replace me.

从那时起，我试着找出我是谁，是什么让我变得特别。我以一种新的方式看待自己。然后我开始积极的面对我的生活，我为自己的真实感到高兴。我开始感觉好多了，因为我知道没有人能取代我。

Each of us holds a special place in the world.You are special, no matter what others say or what you may think.So forget that you will be replaced.You can't be.

我们每个人在世界上都占有特殊的地位。不管别人怎么说，不管你怎么想，你都是特别的。所以，忘记你会被取代。你不会被取代。
