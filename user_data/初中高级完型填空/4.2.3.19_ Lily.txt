Everyone has dreams. Lily dreamed of being a dancer. She took dancing lessons and all her teachers thought she was an excellent student. 

每个人都有梦想。莉莉梦想成为一名舞者。她上舞蹈课，所有的老师都认为她是一个优秀的学生。

One day she saw a notice. It said that a famous dancing group would be performing in her town. She thought, “I must show the leader my dancing skills. ”She waited for the group leader in the dressing room. When the leader appeared, she came up and handed him the flowers she had prepared. The thorns hurt her fingers and blood came out. But she was too excited to care about the pain. She expressed her strong wish to be a dancer and begged to show her dance. 

一天，她看到一个通知。它说一个著名的舞蹈团将在她的镇上表演。她想:“我一定要让领导看看我的舞技。”她在更衣室里等组长。当领导出现时，她走上前来，把她准备好的花递给了他。荆棘刺痛了她的手指，血流了出来。但她太兴奋了，根本顾不上疼痛。她表达了她想成为一名舞者的强烈愿望，并请求表演她的舞蹈。

“All right, you dance. ”The leader agreed. But halfway through the dance, he stopped her, “I'm sorry, in my mind you're not good enough!”On hearing this, Lily ran out as fast as her legs could carry her. It was so hard for her to accept this. She lost heart and gave up her dream. 

“好吧，你跳吧。”领袖同意了。但跳到一半，他打断了她:“对不起，在我看来你不够好!”听到这些，莉莉以最快的速度跑了出去。她很难接受这个事实。她失去了信心，放弃了梦想。

Several years later, the dancing group came to her town again. She decided to find out why the leader had told her she was not good enough. This was his reply, “I tell this to every student. ”“You've ruined my life!” she shouted angrily. 

几年后，这个舞蹈团又来到了她的小镇。她决定找出领导为什么说她不够好。他回答说:“我对每个学生都这么说。”“你毁了我的生活!”她生气地喊道。

The leader went on, “I remember your present of flowers and how the thorns had hurt your fingers but you carried on bravely.  It was a pity that you didn't take dancing like that and stopped trying so easily. ​ So you are still not good enough for dancing!”

首领继续说:“我记得你送的花，还有你的手指被荆棘刺痛了，但你勇敢地坚持了下来。遗憾的是，你没有那么喜欢跳舞，也没那么容易就放弃了。所以你还是不适合跳舞!”
