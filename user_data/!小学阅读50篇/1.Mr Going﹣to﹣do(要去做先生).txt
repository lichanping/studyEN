People always call Mr Brown "Mr Going﹣to﹣do". Do you know why？ Because Mr Brown always says he is going to do something，but he never does it.
Mr Smith lives next to Mr Brown. Every Saturday，Mr Brown talks to his neighbour Mr Smith. He always says he is going to do something.
He says，"I'm going to clean my house today." or "I'm going to wash my car tomorrow." or "I'm going to clean the garden next week."
Mr Smith knows his neighbour is not going to clean his house，or wash his car，or clean his garden. Then he says，"Excuse me，Mr Brown.I'm going to do some work in my house."
Mr Smith often says to his son Dick，"Are you going to do something？Then do it.Don't be another 'Mr Going﹣to﹣do'."
