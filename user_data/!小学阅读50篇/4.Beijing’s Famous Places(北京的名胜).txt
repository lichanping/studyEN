I'm Alex. I'm from Beijing. Beijing is the capital of China. The city is very very big and beautiful. It has a long history. There are many famous places in Beijing，such as the Summer Palace，the Great Wall and the Palace Museum. Every year I visit the Great Wall with my family or my classmates. The Great Wall is very long. It's wonderful. Want to have a look？ You should take a trip to the Great Wall. As someone says，"He who has never been to the Great Wall is not a true man." When I climb it，I feel great. I love the Great Wall. I'm happy I'm Chinese.

我是亚历克斯。我来自北京。北京是中国的首都。这座城市非常非常大，而且很美。它有着悠久的历史。北京有许多著名的地方，比如颐和园、长城和故宫博物院。每年我都会和家人或同学一起去游览长城。长城非常长，它很壮观。想看看吗？你应该去长城旅行一次。正如有人所说：“不到长城非好汉。”当我攀登长城时，我感觉棒极了。我爱长城。我为自己是中国人而感到自豪。
