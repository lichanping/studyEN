I'm Alex. I'm from Beijing. Beijing is the capital of China. The city is very very big and beautiful. It has a long history. There are many famous places in Beijing，such as the Summer Palace，the Great Wall and the Palace Museum. Every year I visit the Great Wall with my family or my classmates. The Great Wall is very long. It's wonderful. Want to have a look？ You should take a trip to the Great Wall. As someone says，"He who has never been to the Great Wall is not a true man." When I climb it，I feel great. I love the Great Wall. I'm happy I'm Chinese.
