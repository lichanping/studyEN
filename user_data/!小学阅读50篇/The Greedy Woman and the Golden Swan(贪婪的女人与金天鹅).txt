There is a swan with golden feathers. She lives near a lake in a forest.
A woman lives in a small house near the lake with her two kids. They work hard all the year，but still live a hard life. Sometimes they even don't have enough money to buy food. The swan is sad to see that. She gives one of the golden feathers to them every evening，and their life gets much better.
Day after day，the woman becomes greedy. She wants to take all the swan's feathers. When the swan comes，the woman catches her and takes her feathers. But the golden feathers on the floor change into chicken feathers.

森林里有一只长着金羽毛的天鹅，它住在湖边。
湖边的小屋里住着一位妇女和她的两个孩子。他们一年到头辛勤劳作，生活却依旧困苦，有时甚至没钱买食物。天鹅看到这一切十分难过，于是每天晚上都会送给他们一根金羽毛，从此他们的生活得到了很大改善。
日复一日，妇女变得越来越贪婪，她想拿走天鹅身上所有的羽毛。当天鹅再来时，她抓住了它并拔下羽毛，可掉在地上的金羽毛却全都变成了鸡毛。
