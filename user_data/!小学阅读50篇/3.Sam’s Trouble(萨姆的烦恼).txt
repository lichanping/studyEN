Dear Miss White，I'm very sad these days. My parents are too strict with me. Every day I study for a longtime and have no time to play. They always say，"Don't watch TV. Do your homework quickly!" I feel tired. What should I do？

亲爱的怀特老师：
这些天我很伤心。我的父母对我太严格了。每天我都要学习很长时间，没有时间玩。他们总是说：“别看电视，快点做作业！”我感觉很累。我该怎么办？

Dear Sam，Don't be sad. You can talk with your parents about your troubles. Tell them you'll study hard. Tell them you want to watch TV after you finish your homework. But you can't watch TV for a long time. You must protect your eyes. If you are still sad，Welcome to the teachers' office. You can come here on Thursday. And I usually have no class that day.

亲爱的山姆：
别难过。你可以和父母谈谈你的烦恼。告诉他们你会努力学习，也告诉他们你想在完成作业后看一会儿电视，但不能看太久，一定要保护好眼睛。如果你还是难过，欢迎来教师办公室找我，我周四通常没课，你可以那天过来。
