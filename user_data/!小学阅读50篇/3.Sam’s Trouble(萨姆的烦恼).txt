Dear Miss White，I'm very sad these days. My parents are too strict with me. Every day I study for a longtime and have no time to play. They always say，"Don't watch TV.Do your homework quickly!" I feel tired. What should I do？
Dear Sam，Don't be sad. You can talk with your parents about your troubles. Tell them you'll study hard. Tell them you want to watch TV after you finish your homework. But you can't watch TV for a long time. You must protect your eyes. If you are still sad，welcome to the teachers' office. You can come here on Thursday. And I usually have no class that day.
